<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>

<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>
<s> for all knowledge of human nature leads ultimately to repose and i shall write to little purpose if i do not assist some portion of my readers to form an estimate of the grounds of hope and fear in the present effort of liberty against oppression in the present or any future struggle which justice will have to maintain against might <\s>
<s> in fact this is my main object the sea mark of my utmost sail in order that understanding the sources of strength and seats of weakness both in the tyrant and in those who would save or rescue themselves from his grasp we may act as becomes men who would guard their own liberties and would draw a good use from the desire which they feel and the efforts which they are making to benefit the less favoured part of the family of mankind <\s>

<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>

<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>

<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>

<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>

<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>

<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>
<s> for all knowledge of human nature leads ultimately to repose and i shall write to little purpose if i do not assist some portion of my readers to form an estimate of the grounds of hope and fear in the present effort of liberty against oppression in the present or any future struggle which justice will have to maintain against might <\s>
<s> in fact this is my main object the sea mark of my utmost sail in order that understanding the sources of strength and seats of weakness both in the tyrant and in those who would save or rescue themselves from his grasp we may act as becomes men who would guard their own liberties and would draw a good use from the desire which they feel and the efforts which they are making to benefit the less favoured part of the family of mankind <\s>
<s> with these as my ultimate objects i have undertaken to examine the convention of cintra and as an indispensible preparative for forming a right judgment of this event i have already faithfully exhibited the feelings of the people of great britain and of spain towards each other and have shewn by what sacred bonds they were united <\s>
<s> with the same view i shall next proceed to shew by what barrier of aversion scarcely less sacred the people of the peninsula were divided from their enemies their feelings towards them and their hopes for themselves trusting that i have already mitigated the deadening influences of recent calamity and that the representation i shall frame in the manner which has been promised will speak in its true colours and life to the eye and heart of the spectator <\s>

<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>

<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>

<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>

<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>

<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>

<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>

<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>

<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>

<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>

<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>

<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>
<s> for all knowledge of human nature leads ultimately to repose and i shall write to little purpose if i do not assist some portion of my readers to form an estimate of the grounds of hope and fear in the present effort of liberty against oppression in the present or any future struggle which justice will have to maintain against might <\s>
<s> in fact this is my main object the sea mark of my utmost sail in order that understanding the sources of strength and seats of weakness both in the tyrant and in those who would save or rescue themselves from his grasp we may act as becomes men who would guard their own liberties and would draw a good use from the desire which they feel and the efforts which they are making to benefit the less favoured part of the family of mankind <\s>
<s> with these as my ultimate objects i have undertaken to examine the convention of cintra and as an indispensible preparative for forming a right judgment of this event i have already faithfully exhibited the feelings of the people of great britain and of spain towards each other and have shewn by what sacred bonds they were united <\s>
<s> with the same view i shall next proceed to shew by what barrier of aversion scarcely less sacred the people of the peninsula were divided from their enemies their feelings towards them and their hopes for themselves trusting that i have already mitigated the deadening influences of recent calamity and that the representation i shall frame in the manner which has been promised will speak in its true colours and life to the eye and heart of the spectator <\s>

<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>

<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>

<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>

<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>

<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>

<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>

<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>

<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>

<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>

<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>

<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>
<s> for all knowledge of human nature leads ultimately to repose and i shall write to little purpose if i do not assist some portion of my readers to form an estimate of the grounds of hope and fear in the present effort of liberty against oppression in the present or any future struggle which justice will have to maintain against might <\s>
<s> in fact this is my main object the sea mark of my utmost sail in order that understanding the sources of strength and seats of weakness both in the tyrant and in those who would save or rescue themselves from his grasp we may act as becomes men who would guard their own liberties and would draw a good use from the desire which they feel and the efforts which they are making to benefit the less favoured part of the family of mankind <\s>
<s> with these as my ultimate objects i have undertaken to examine the convention of cintra and as an indispensible preparative for forming a right judgment of this event i have already faithfully exhibited the feelings of the people of great britain and of spain towards each other and have shewn by what sacred bonds they were united <\s>
<s> with the same view i shall next proceed to shew by what barrier of aversion scarcely less sacred the people of the peninsula were divided from their enemies their feelings towards them and their hopes for themselves trusting that i have already mitigated the deadening influences of recent calamity and that the representation i shall frame in the manner which has been promised will speak in its true colours and life to the eye and heart of the spectator <\s>

<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>

<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>

<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>

<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>

<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>

<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>

<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>

<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>

<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>

<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>

<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>
<s> for all knowledge of human nature leads ultimately to repose and i shall write to little purpose if i do not assist some portion of my readers to form an estimate of the grounds of hope and fear in the present effort of liberty against oppression in the present or any future struggle which justice will have to maintain against might <\s>
<s> in fact this is my main object the sea mark of my utmost sail in order that understanding the sources of strength and seats of weakness both in the tyrant and in those who would save or rescue themselves from his grasp we may act as becomes men who would guard their own liberties and would draw a good use from the desire which they feel and the efforts which they are making to benefit the less favoured part of the family of mankind <\s>
<s> with these as my ultimate objects i have undertaken to examine the convention of cintra and as an indispensible preparative for forming a right judgment of this event i have already faithfully exhibited the feelings of the people of great britain and of spain towards each other and have shewn by what sacred bonds they were united <\s>
<s> with the same view i shall next proceed to shew by what barrier of aversion scarcely less sacred the people of the peninsula were divided from their enemies their feelings towards them and their hopes for themselves trusting that i have already mitigated the deadening influences of recent calamity and that the representation i shall frame in the manner which has been promised will speak in its true colours and life to the eye and heart of the spectator <\s>

<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>

<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>

<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>

<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>

<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>

<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>

<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>

<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>

<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>

<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>

<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>
<s> for all knowledge of human nature leads ultimately to repose and i shall write to little purpose if i do not assist some portion of my readers to form an estimate of the grounds of hope and fear in the present effort of liberty against oppression in the present or any future struggle which justice will have to maintain against might <\s>
<s> in fact this is my main object the sea mark of my utmost sail in order that understanding the sources of strength and seats of weakness both in the tyrant and in those who would save or rescue themselves from his grasp we may act as becomes men who would guard their own liberties and would draw a good use from the desire which they feel and the efforts which they are making to benefit the less favoured part of the family of mankind <\s>
<s> with these as my ultimate objects i have undertaken to examine the convention of cintra and as an indispensible preparative for forming a right judgment of this event i have already faithfully exhibited the feelings of the people of great britain and of spain towards each other and have shewn by what sacred bonds they were united <\s>
<s> with the same view i shall next proceed to shew by what barrier of aversion scarcely less sacred the people of the peninsula were divided from their enemies their feelings towards them and their hopes for themselves trusting that i have already mitigated the deadening influences of recent calamity and that the representation i shall frame in the manner which has been promised will speak in its true colours and life to the eye and heart of the spectator <\s>

<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>

<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>

<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>

<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>

<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>

<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>

<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>

<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>

<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>

<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>

<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>
<s> for all knowledge of human nature leads ultimately to repose and i shall write to little purpose if i do not assist some portion of my readers to form an estimate of the grounds of hope and fear in the present effort of liberty against oppression in the present or any future struggle which justice will have to maintain against might <\s>
<s> in fact this is my main object the sea mark of my utmost sail in order that understanding the sources of strength and seats of weakness both in the tyrant and in those who would save or rescue themselves from his grasp we may act as becomes men who would guard their own liberties and would draw a good use from the desire which they feel and the efforts which they are making to benefit the less favoured part of the family of mankind <\s>
<s> with these as my ultimate objects i have undertaken to examine the convention of cintra and as an indispensible preparative for forming a right judgment of this event i have already faithfully exhibited the feelings of the people of great britain and of spain towards each other and have shewn by what sacred bonds they were united <\s>
<s> with the same view i shall next proceed to shew by what barrier of aversion scarcely less sacred the people of the peninsula were divided from their enemies their feelings towards them and their hopes for themselves trusting that i have already mitigated the deadening influences of recent calamity and that the representation i shall frame in the manner which has been promised will speak in its true colours and life to the eye and heart of the spectator <\s>

<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>

<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>

<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>

<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>

<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>

<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>

<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>

<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>

<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>

<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>

<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>

<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>

<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>

<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>
<s> rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one <\s>
<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>
<s> because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunder storm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians <\s>
<s> wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies <\s>
<s> if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed <\s>
<s> a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it <\s>
<s> for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty <\s>
<s> the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter <\s>
<s> it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far <\s>
<s> but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute <\s>
<s> for all knowledge of human nature leads ultimately to repose and i shall write to little purpose if i do not assist some portion of my readers to form an estimate of the grounds of hope and fear in the present effort of liberty against oppression in the present or any future struggle which justice will have to maintain against might <\s>
<s> in fact this is my main object the sea mark of my utmost sail in order that understanding the sources of strength and seats of weakness both in the tyrant and in those who would save or rescue themselves from his grasp we may act as becomes men who would guard their own liberties and would draw a good use from the desire which they feel and the efforts which they are making to benefit the less favoured part of the family of mankind <\s>
<s> with these as my ultimate objects i have undertaken to examine the convention of cintra and as an indispensible preparative for forming a right judgment of this event i have already faithfully exhibited the feelings of the people of great britain and of spain towards each other and have shewn by what sacred bonds they were united <\s>
<s> with the same view i shall next proceed to shew by what barrier of aversion scarcely less sacred the people of the peninsula were divided from their enemies their feelings towards them and their hopes for themselves trusting that i have already mitigated the deadening influences of recent calamity and that the representation i shall frame in the manner which has been promised will speak in its true colours and life to the eye and heart of the spectator <\s>

<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>

<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
<s> therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve <\s>

<s> why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france <\s>

<s> portuguese your lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth <\s>
<s> your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measure you were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves <\s>
<s> junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance <\s>
<s> you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves <\s>
<s> your nobility has been annihilated its property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty <\s>
<s> you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron <\s>
<s> even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purpose by destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspires spain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair <\s>
<s> you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance <\s>
<s> but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany your's by which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europe our loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity <\s>
<s> we have broken our chains let us then to action <\s>
<s> but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her <\s>
<s> doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting you he expects to find faithful subjects shall he find only rebels <\s>
<s> i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing cities shall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodies merit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits you every city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the sword every individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot <\s>
<s> that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze <\s>
<s> we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage <\s>
<s> the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned <\s>
<s> again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal <\s>
<s> describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terrible more than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets <\s>
<s> on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubt 'it was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed up 'in the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded <\s>
<s> the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashes into vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape <\s>
<s> for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation <\s>
<s> it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak <\s>
<s> this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred <\s>
<s> in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence <\s>
<s> that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereign's authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain <\s>
<s> the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices <\s>
<s> this dignified feeling of self restraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctance but when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious <\s>
<s> nothing but good would result from such conduct <\s>
<s> the well disposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself <\s>
<s> men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented <\s>
<s> the course which ought to be pursued is plain <\s>
<s> either the cause has lost the people's love or it has not <\s>
<s> if it has let the struggle be abandoned <\s>
<s> if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power <\s>
<s> if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes <\s>
<s> thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people <\s>
<s> the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else <\s>
<s> five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisoners i think it was at the battle of rio seco were returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops <\s>
<s> the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy <\s>
<s> but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle <\s>
<s> for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinion not merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas <\s>
<s> even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms <\s>
<s> the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature <\s>
<s> a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land <\s>
<s> i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterity to which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions <\s>
<s> we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realized the civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other <\s>
<s> the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments <\s>
<s> but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service <\s>
<s> they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public good but the enemy is in the heart of their land <\s>
<s> we have not forgotten this <\s>
<s> we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung <\s>
<s> for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation <\s>
<s> nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for <\s>
<s> moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish <\s>
<s> these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader <\s>
<s> they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites again these are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend <\s>
<s> these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy <\s>
<s> yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat <\s>
<s> for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their cause of course that it was moral <\s>
<s> why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior <\s>
<s> moral strength is their's but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies <\s>
<s> this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak <\s>
<s> nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title <\s>
<s> but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiel a bonaparte equally with a leonidas <\s>
<s> they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle <\s>
<s> but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader <\s>
<s> if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation <\s>
<s> nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contra distinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle <\s>
