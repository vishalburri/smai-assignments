<s> not a street not a public room not a fire side in the island which was not disturbed as by a local or private trouble men of all estates conditions and tempers were affected apparently in equal degrees <\s>

<s> in a word it would not be too much to say that the tidings of this event did not spread with the commotion of a storm which sweeps visibly over our heads but like an earthquake which rocks the ground under our feet <\s>
<s> how was it possible that it could be otherwise <\s>
<s> for that army had been sent upon a service which appealed so strongly to all that was human in the heart of this nation that there was scarcely a gallant father of a family who had not his moments of regret that he was not a soldier by profession which might have made it his duty to accompany it every high minded youth grieved that his first impulses which would have sent him upon the same errand were not to be yielded to and that after thought did not sanction and confirm the instantaneous dictates or the reiterated persuasions of an heroic spirit <\s>
<s> the army took its departure with prayers and blessings which were as widely spread as they were fervent and intense <\s>
<s> for it was not doubted that on this occasion every person of which it was composed from the general to the private soldier would carry both into his conflicts with the enemy in the field and into his relations of peaceful intercourse with the inhabitants not only the virtues which might be expected from him as a soldier but the antipathies and sympathies the loves and hatreds of a citizen of a human being acting in a manner hitherto unprecedented under the obligation of his human and social nature <\s>
<s> if the conduct of the rapacious and merciless adversary rendered it neither easy nor wise made it i might say impossible to give way to that unqualified admiration of courage and skill made it impossible in relation to him to be exalted by those triumphs of the courteous affections and to be purified by those refinements of civility which do more than any thing reconcile a man of thoughtful mind and humane dispositions to the horrors of ordinary war it was felt that for such loss the benign and accomplished soldier would upon this mission be abundantly recompensed by the enthusiasm of fraternal love with which his ally the oppressed people whom he was going to aid in rescuing themselves would receive him and that this and the virtues which he would witness in them would furnish his heart with never failing and far nobler objects of complacency and admiration <\s>
<s> the discipline of the army was well known and as a machine or a vital organized body the nation was assured that it could not but be formidable but thus to the standing excellence of mechanic or organic power seemed to be superadded at this time and for this service the force of inspiration could any thing therefore be looked for but a glorious result <\s>
<s> the army proved its prowess in the field and what has been the result is attested and long will be attested by the downcast looks the silence the passionate exclamations the sighs and shame of every man who is worthy to breathe the air or to look upon the green fields of liberty in this blessed and highly favoured island which we inhabit <\s>
<s> if i were speaking of things however weighty that were long past and dwindled in the memory i should scarcely venture to use this language but the feelings are of yesterday they are of to day the flower a melancholy flower it is <\s>
<s> is still in blow nor will i trust its leaves be shed through months that are to come for i repeat that the heart of the nation is in this struggle <\s>
<s> this just and necessary war as we have been accustomed to hear it styled from the beginning of the contest in the year 1793 had some time before the treaty of amiens viz <\s>
<s> after the subjugation of switzerland and not till then begun to be regarded by the body of the people as indeed both just and necessary and this justice and necessity were by none more clearly perceived or more feelingly bewailed than by those who had most eagerly opposed the war in its commencement and who continued most bitterly to regret that this nation had ever borne a part in it <\s>
<s> their conduct was herein consistent they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles for though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition <\s>
<s> this spirit the class of persons of whom i have been speaking and i would now be understood as associating them with an immense majority of the people of great britain whose affections notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them were in the former part of the contest for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies this spirit when it became undeniably embodied in the french government they wished in spite of all dangers should be opposed by war because peace was not to be procured without submission which could not but be followed by a communion of which the word of greeting would be on the one part insult and on the other degradation <\s>
<s> the people now wished for war as their rulers had done before because open war between nations is a defined and effectual partition and the sword in the hands of the good and the virtuous is the most intelligible symbol of abhorrence <\s>
<s> it was in order to be preserved from spirit breaking submissions from the guilt of seeming to approve that which they had not the power to prevent and out of a consciousness of the danger that such guilt would otherwise actually steal upon them and that thus by evil communications and participations would be weakened and finally destroyed those moral sensibilities and energies by virtue of which alone their liberties and even their lives could be preserved that the people of great britain determined to encounter all perils which could follow in the train of open resistance there were some and those deservedly of high character in the country who exerted their utmost influence to counteract this resolution nor did they give to it so gentle a name as want of prudence but they boldly termed it blindness and obstinacy <\s>
<s> let them be judged with charity <\s>
<s> but there are promptings of wisdom from the penetralia of human nature which a people can hear though the wisest of their practical statesmen be deaf towards them <\s>
<s> this authentic voice the people of england had heard and obeyed and in opposition to french tyranny growing daily more insatiate and implacable they ranged themselves zealously under their government though they neither forgot nor forgave its transgressions in having first involved them in a war with a people then struggling for its own liberties under a twofold infliction confounded by inbred faction and beleagured by a cruel and imperious external foe <\s>
<s> but these remembrances did not vent themselves in reproaches nor hinder us from being reconciled to our rulers when a change or rather a revolution in circumstances had imposed new duties and in defiance of local and personal clamour it may be safely said that the nation united heart and hand with the government in its resolve to meet the worst rather than stoop its head to receive that which it was felt would not be the garland but the yoke of peace <\s>
<s> yet it was an afflicting alternative and it is not to be denied that the effort if it had the determination wanted the cheerfulness of duty <\s>
<s> our condition savoured too much of a grinding constraint too much of the vassalage of necessity it had too much of fear and therefore of selfishness not to be contemplated in the main with rueful emotion <\s>
<s> we desponded though we did not despair <\s>
<s> in fact a deliberate and preparatory fortitude a sedate and stern melancholy which had no sunshine and was exhilarated only by the lightnings of indignation this was the highest and best state of moral feeling to which the most noble minded among us could attain <\s>
<s> but from the moment of the rising of the people of the pyrenëan peninsula there was a mighty change we were instantaneously animated and from that moment the contest assumed the dignity which it is not in the power of any thing but hope to bestow and if i may dare to transfer language prompted by a revelation of the state of being that admits not of decay or change to the concerns and interests of our transitory planet from that moment this corruptible put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality <\s>
<s> this sudden elevation was on no account more welcome was by nothing more endeared than by the returning sense which accompanied it of inward liberty and choice which gratified our moral yearnings inasmuch as it would give henceforward to our actions as a people an origination and direction unquestionably moral as it was free as it was manifestly in sympathy with the species as it admitted therefore of fluctuations of generous feeling of approbation and of complacency <\s>
<s> we were intellectualized also in proportion we looked backward upon the records of the human race with pride and instead of being afraid we delighted to look forward into futurity <\s>
<s> it was imagined that this new born spirit of resistance rising from the most sacred feelings of the human heart would diffuse itself through many countries and not merely for the distant future but for the present hopes were entertained as bold as they were disinterested and generous <\s>
<s> never indeed was the fellowship of our sentient nature more intimately felt never was the irresistible power of justice more gloriously displayed than when the british and spanish nations with an impulse like that of two ancient heroes throwing down their weapons and reconciled in the field cast off at once their aversions and enmities and mutually embraced each other to solemnize this conversion of love not by the festivities of peace but by combating side by side through danger and under affliction in the devotedness of perfect brotherhood <\s>
<s> this was a conjunction which excited hope as fervent as it was rational <\s>
<s> on the one side was a nation which brought with it sanction and authority inasmuch as it had tried and approved the blessings for which the other had risen to contend the one was a people which by the help of the surrounding ocean and its own virtues had preserved to itself through ages its liberty pure and inviolated by a foreign invader the other a high minded nation which a tyrant presuming on its decrepitude had through the real decrepitude of its government perfidiously enslaved <\s>
<s> what could be more delightful than to think of an intercourse beginning in this manner <\s>
<s> on the part of the spaniards their love towards us was enthusiasm and adoration the faults of our national character were hidden from them by a veil of splendour they saw nothing around us but glory and light and on our side we estimated their character with partial and indulgent fondness thinking on their past greatness not as the undermined foundation of a magnificent building but as the root of a majestic tree recovered from a long disease and beginning again to flourish with promise of wider branches and a deeper shade than it had boasted in the fulness of its strength <\s>
<s> if in the sensations with which the spaniards prostrated themselves before the religion of their country we did not keep pace with them if even their loyalty was such as from our mixed constitution of government and from other causes we could not thoroughly sympathize with and if lastly their devotion to the person of their sovereign appeared to us to have too much of the alloy of delusion in all these things we judged them gently and taught by the reverses of the french revolution we looked upon these dispositions as more human more social and therefore as wiser and of better omen than if they had stood forth the zealots of abstract principles drawn out of the laboratory of unfeeling philosophists <\s>
<s> finally in this reverence for the past and present we found an earnest that they were prepared to contend to the death for as much liberty as their habits and their knowledge enabled them to receive <\s>
<s> to assist them and their neighbours the portugueze in the attainment of this end we sent to them in love and in friendship a powerful army to aid to invigorate and to chastise they landed and the first proof they afforded of their being worthy to be sent on such a service the first pledge of amity given by them was the victory of vimiera the second pledge and this was from the hand of their generals was the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the reader will by this time have perceived what thoughts were uppermost in my mind when i began with asserting that this convention is among the most important events of our times an assertion which was made deliberately and after due allowance for that infirmity which inclines us to magnify things present and passing at the expence of those which are past <\s>
<s> it is my aim to prove wherein the real importance of this event lies and as a necessary preparative for forming a right judgment upon it i have already given a representation of the sentiments with which the people of great britain and those of spain looked upon each other <\s>
<s> i have indeed spoken rather of the spaniards than of the portugueze but what has been said will be understood as applying in the main to the whole peninsula <\s>
<s> the wrongs of the two nations have been equal and their cause is the same they must stand or fall together <\s>
<s> what their wrongs have been in what degree they considered themselves united and what their hopes and resolutions were we have learned from public papers issued by themselves and by their enemies <\s>
<s> these were read by the people of this country at the time when they were severally published with due impression pity that those impressions could not have been as faithfully retained as they were at first received deeply <\s>
<s> doubtless there is not a man in these islands who is not convinced that the cause of spain is the most righteous cause in which since the opposition of the greek republics to the persian invader at thermopylae and marathon sword ever was drawn <\s>
<s> but this is not enough <\s>
<s> we are actors in the struggle and in order that we may have steady principles to controul and direct us without which we may do much harm and can do no good we ought to make it a duty to revive in the memory those words and facts which first carried the conviction to our hearts that as far as it is possible we may see as we then saw and feel as we then felt <\s>
<s> let me therefore entreat the reader seriously to peruse once more such parts of those declarations as i shall extract from them <\s>
<s> i feel indeed with sorrow that events are hurrying us forward as down the rapid of an american river and that there is too much danger before to permit the mind easily to turn back upon the course which is past <\s>
<s> it is indeed difficult but i need not say that to yield to the difficulty would be degrading to rational beings <\s>
<s> besides if from the retrospect we can either gain strength by which we can overcome or learn prudence by which we may avoid such submission is not only degrading but pernicious <\s>
<s> i address these words to those who have feeling but whose judgment is overpowered by their feelings such as have not and who are mere slaves of curiosity calling perpetually for something new and being able to create nothing new for themselves out of old materials may be left to wander about under the yoke of their own unprofitable appetite yet not so <\s>
<s> even these i would include in my request and conjure them as they are men not to be impatient while i place before their eyes a composition made out of fragments of those declarations from various parts of the peninsula which disposed as it were in a tesselated pavement shall set forth a story which may be easily understood which will move and teach and be consolatory to him who looks upon it <\s>
<s> i say consolatory and let not the reader shrink from the word <\s>
<s> i am well aware of the burthen which is to be supported of the discountenance from recent calamity under which every thing which speaks of hope for the spanish people and through them for mankind will be received <\s>
<s> but this far from deterring ought to be an encouragement it makes the duty more imperious <\s>
<s> nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature <\s>
<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>
<s> for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits <\s>
<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>
<s> yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success <\s>
<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>
<s> may heaven avert from the minds of my countrymen the slightest wish to abolish their constitution <\s>
<s> locke have been overturned by the pride ambition and turbulency of private men by the people's wantonness and desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers as well as by the rulers insolence and endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over the people <\s>
<s> the recent danger to our constitution was in my opinion small for i considered its excellence to be so obvious to men even of the most unimproved understandings that i looked upon it as an idle and fruitless effort either in foreign or domestic incendiaries to endeavour to persuade the bulk of the people to consent to an alteration of it in favour of a republic <\s>

<s> it is my aim to prove wherein the real importance of this event lies and as a necessary preparative for forming a right judgment upon it i have already given a representation of the sentiments with which the people of great britain and those of spain looked upon each other <\s>

<s> we are actors in the struggle and in order that we may have steady principles to controul and direct us without which we may do much harm and can do no good we ought to make it a duty to revive in the memory those words and facts which first carried the conviction to our hearts that as far as it is possible we may see as we then saw and feel as we then felt <\s>
<s> let me therefore entreat the reader seriously to peruse once more such parts of those declarations as i shall extract from them <\s>
<s> i feel indeed with sorrow that events are hurrying us forward as down the rapid of an american river and that there is too much danger before to permit the mind easily to turn back upon the course which is past <\s>
<s> it is indeed difficult but i need not say that to yield to the difficulty would be degrading to rational beings <\s>
<s> besides if from the retrospect we can either gain strength by which we can overcome or learn prudence by which we may avoid such submission is not only degrading but pernicious <\s>

<s> even these i would include in my request and conjure them as they are men not to be impatient while i place before their eyes a composition made out of fragments of those declarations from various parts of the peninsula which disposed as it were in a tesselated pavement shall set forth a story which may be easily understood which will move and teach and be consolatory to him who looks upon it <\s>
<s> i say consolatory and let not the reader shrink from the word <\s>
<s> i am well aware of the burthen which is to be supported of the discountenance from recent calamity under which every thing which speaks of hope for the spanish people and through them for mankind will be received <\s>
<s> but this far from deterring ought to be an encouragement it makes the duty more imperious <\s>
<s> nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature <\s>
<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>
<s> for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits <\s>
<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>
<s> yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success <\s>
<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>
<s> may heaven avert from the minds of my countrymen the slightest wish to abolish their constitution <\s>
<s> locke have been overturned by the pride ambition and turbulency of private men by the people's wantonness and desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers as well as by the rulers insolence and endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over the people <\s>
<s> the recent danger to our constitution was in my opinion small for i considered its excellence to be so obvious to men even of the most unimproved understandings that i looked upon it as an idle and fruitless effort either in foreign or domestic incendiaries to endeavour to persuade the bulk of the people to consent to an alteration of it in favour of a republic <\s>
<s> i knew indeed that in every country the flagitious dregs of a nation were always ripe for revolutions but i was sensible at the same time that it was the interest not only of the opulent and powerful not only of the mercantile and middle classes of life but even of honest labourers and manufacturers of every sober and industrious man to resist the licentious principles of such pestilent members shall i call them or outcasts of society <\s>
<s> men better informed and wiser than myself thought that the constitution was in great danger <\s>
<s> whether in fact the danger was great or small it is not necessary now to inquire it may be more useful to declare that in my humble opinion the danger of whatever magnitude it may have been did not originate in any encroachments of either the legislative or executive power on the liberties or properties of the people but in the wild fancies and turbulent tempers of discontented or ill informed individuals <\s>
<s> i sincerely rejoice that through the vigilance of administration this turbulency has received a check <\s>
<s> the hopes of bad men have been disappointed and the understandings of mistaken men have been enlightened by the general and unequivocal judgment of a whole nation a nation not more renowned for its bravery and its humanity though justly celebrated for both than for its loyalty to its princes and what is perfectly consistent with loyalty for its love of liberty and attachment to the constitution <\s>

<s> on the convention of cintra see preface in the present volume <\s>

<s> qui didicit patriae quid debeat quod sit conscripti quod judicis officium quae partes in bellum missi ducis <\s>

<s> bitter and earnest writing must not hastily be condemned for men cannot contend coldly and without affection about things which they hold dear and precious <\s>
<s> a politic man may write from his brain without touch and sense of his heart as in a speculation that appertaineth not unto him but a feeling christian will express in his words a character of zeal or love <\s>
<s> the following pages originated in the opposition which was made by his majesty's ministers to the expression in public meetings and otherwise of the opinions and feelings of the people concerning the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> for the sake of immediate and general circulation i determined when i had made a considerable progress in the manuscript to print it in different portions in one of the daily newspapers <\s>
<s> accordingly two portions of it extending to page 25 were printed in the months of december and january in the courier as being one of the most impartial and extensively circulated journals of the time <\s>
<s> the reader is requested to bear in mind this previous publication otherwise he will be at a loss to account for the arrangement of the matter in one instance in the earlier part of the work <\s>
<s> an accidental loss of several sheets of the manuscript delayed the continuance of the publication in that manner till the close of the christmas holidays and the pressure of public business rendering it then improbable that room could be found in the columns of the paper regularly to insert matter extending to such a length this plan of publication was given up <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state that in the extracts which have been made from the spanish proclamations i have been obliged to content myself with the translations which appeared in the public journals having only in one instance had access to the original <\s>
<s> this is in some cases to be regretted where the language falls below the dignity of the matter but in general it is not so and the feeling has suggested correspondent expressions to the translators hastily as no doubt they must have performed their work <\s>
<s> i must entreat the reader to bear in mind that i began to write upon this subject in november last and have continued without bringing my work earlier to a conclusion partly from accident and partly from a wish to possess additional documents and facts <\s>
<s> passing occurrences have made changes in the situation of certain objects spoken of but i have not thought it necessary to accommodate what i had previously written to these changes the whole stands without alteration except where additions have been made or errors corrected <\s>
<s> as i have spoken without reserve of things and of persons as far as it was necessary to illustrate things but no further ); and as this has been uniformly done according to the light of my conscience i have deemed it right to prefix my name to these pages in order that this last testimony of a sincere mind might not be wanting <\s>
<s> concerning the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the convention recently concluded by the generals at the head of the british army in portugal is one of the most important events of our time <\s>
<s> it would be deemed so in france if the ruler of that country could dare to make it public with those merely of its known bearings and dependences with which the english people are acquainted it has been deemed so in spain and portugal as far as the people of those countries have been permitted to gain or have gained a knowledge of it and what this nation has felt and still feels upon the subject is sufficiently manifest <\s>
<s> wherever the tidings were communicated they carried agitation along with them a conflict of sensations in which though sorrow was predominant yet through force of scorn impatience hope and indignation and through the universal participation in passions so complex and the sense of power which this necessarily included the whole partook of the energy and activity of congratulation and joy <\s>
<s> not a street not a public room not a fire side in the island which was not disturbed as by a local or private trouble men of all estates conditions and tempers were affected apparently in equal degrees <\s>
<s> yet was the event by none received as an open and measurable affliction it had indeed features bold and intelligible to every one but there was an under expression which was strange dark and mysterious and accordingly as different notions prevailed or the object was looked at in different points of view we were astonished like men who are overwhelmed without forewarning fearful like men who feel themselves to be helpless and indignant and angry like men who are betrayed <\s>
<s> in a word it would not be too much to say that the tidings of this event did not spread with the commotion of a storm which sweeps visibly over our heads but like an earthquake which rocks the ground under our feet <\s>
<s> how was it possible that it could be otherwise <\s>
<s> for that army had been sent upon a service which appealed so strongly to all that was human in the heart of this nation that there was scarcely a gallant father of a family who had not his moments of regret that he was not a soldier by profession which might have made it his duty to accompany it every high minded youth grieved that his first impulses which would have sent him upon the same errand were not to be yielded to and that after thought did not sanction and confirm the instantaneous dictates or the reiterated persuasions of an heroic spirit <\s>
<s> the army took its departure with prayers and blessings which were as widely spread as they were fervent and intense <\s>
<s> for it was not doubted that on this occasion every person of which it was composed from the general to the private soldier would carry both into his conflicts with the enemy in the field and into his relations of peaceful intercourse with the inhabitants not only the virtues which might be expected from him as a soldier but the antipathies and sympathies the loves and hatreds of a citizen of a human being acting in a manner hitherto unprecedented under the obligation of his human and social nature <\s>
<s> if the conduct of the rapacious and merciless adversary rendered it neither easy nor wise made it i might say impossible to give way to that unqualified admiration of courage and skill made it impossible in relation to him to be exalted by those triumphs of the courteous affections and to be purified by those refinements of civility which do more than any thing reconcile a man of thoughtful mind and humane dispositions to the horrors of ordinary war it was felt that for such loss the benign and accomplished soldier would upon this mission be abundantly recompensed by the enthusiasm of fraternal love with which his ally the oppressed people whom he was going to aid in rescuing themselves would receive him and that this and the virtues which he would witness in them would furnish his heart with never failing and far nobler objects of complacency and admiration <\s>
<s> the discipline of the army was well known and as a machine or a vital organized body the nation was assured that it could not but be formidable but thus to the standing excellence of mechanic or organic power seemed to be superadded at this time and for this service the force of inspiration could any thing therefore be looked for but a glorious result <\s>
<s> the army proved its prowess in the field and what has been the result is attested and long will be attested by the downcast looks the silence the passionate exclamations the sighs and shame of every man who is worthy to breathe the air or to look upon the green fields of liberty in this blessed and highly favoured island which we inhabit <\s>
<s> if i were speaking of things however weighty that were long past and dwindled in the memory i should scarcely venture to use this language but the feelings are of yesterday they are of to day the flower a melancholy flower it is <\s>
<s> is still in blow nor will i trust its leaves be shed through months that are to come for i repeat that the heart of the nation is in this struggle <\s>
<s> this just and necessary war as we have been accustomed to hear it styled from the beginning of the contest in the year 1793 had some time before the treaty of amiens viz <\s>

<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>
<s> for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits <\s>
<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>
<s> yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success <\s>
<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>
<s> may heaven avert from the minds of my countrymen the slightest wish to abolish their constitution <\s>
<s> locke have been overturned by the pride ambition and turbulency of private men by the people's wantonness and desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers as well as by the rulers insolence and endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over the people <\s>
<s> the recent danger to our constitution was in my opinion small for i considered its excellence to be so obvious to men even of the most unimproved understandings that i looked upon it as an idle and fruitless effort either in foreign or domestic incendiaries to endeavour to persuade the bulk of the people to consent to an alteration of it in favour of a republic <\s>
<s> i knew indeed that in every country the flagitious dregs of a nation were always ripe for revolutions but i was sensible at the same time that it was the interest not only of the opulent and powerful not only of the mercantile and middle classes of life but even of honest labourers and manufacturers of every sober and industrious man to resist the licentious principles of such pestilent members shall i call them or outcasts of society <\s>

<s> concerning the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the convention recently concluded by the generals at the head of the british army in portugal is one of the most important events of our time <\s>
<s> it would be deemed so in france if the ruler of that country could dare to make it public with those merely of its known bearings and dependences with which the english people are acquainted it has been deemed so in spain and portugal as far as the people of those countries have been permitted to gain or have gained a knowledge of it and what this nation has felt and still feels upon the subject is sufficiently manifest <\s>
<s> wherever the tidings were communicated they carried agitation along with them a conflict of sensations in which though sorrow was predominant yet through force of scorn impatience hope and indignation and through the universal participation in passions so complex and the sense of power which this necessarily included the whole partook of the energy and activity of congratulation and joy <\s>
<s> not a street not a public room not a fire side in the island which was not disturbed as by a local or private trouble men of all estates conditions and tempers were affected apparently in equal degrees <\s>
<s> yet was the event by none received as an open and measurable affliction it had indeed features bold and intelligible to every one but there was an under expression which was strange dark and mysterious and accordingly as different notions prevailed or the object was looked at in different points of view we were astonished like men who are overwhelmed without forewarning fearful like men who feel themselves to be helpless and indignant and angry like men who are betrayed <\s>
<s> in a word it would not be too much to say that the tidings of this event did not spread with the commotion of a storm which sweeps visibly over our heads but like an earthquake which rocks the ground under our feet <\s>
<s> how was it possible that it could be otherwise <\s>
<s> for that army had been sent upon a service which appealed so strongly to all that was human in the heart of this nation that there was scarcely a gallant father of a family who had not his moments of regret that he was not a soldier by profession which might have made it his duty to accompany it every high minded youth grieved that his first impulses which would have sent him upon the same errand were not to be yielded to and that after thought did not sanction and confirm the instantaneous dictates or the reiterated persuasions of an heroic spirit <\s>
<s> the army took its departure with prayers and blessings which were as widely spread as they were fervent and intense <\s>
<s> for it was not doubted that on this occasion every person of which it was composed from the general to the private soldier would carry both into his conflicts with the enemy in the field and into his relations of peaceful intercourse with the inhabitants not only the virtues which might be expected from him as a soldier but the antipathies and sympathies the loves and hatreds of a citizen of a human being acting in a manner hitherto unprecedented under the obligation of his human and social nature <\s>
<s> if the conduct of the rapacious and merciless adversary rendered it neither easy nor wise made it i might say impossible to give way to that unqualified admiration of courage and skill made it impossible in relation to him to be exalted by those triumphs of the courteous affections and to be purified by those refinements of civility which do more than any thing reconcile a man of thoughtful mind and humane dispositions to the horrors of ordinary war it was felt that for such loss the benign and accomplished soldier would upon this mission be abundantly recompensed by the enthusiasm of fraternal love with which his ally the oppressed people whom he was going to aid in rescuing themselves would receive him and that this and the virtues which he would witness in them would furnish his heart with never failing and far nobler objects of complacency and admiration <\s>
<s> the discipline of the army was well known and as a machine or a vital organized body the nation was assured that it could not but be formidable but thus to the standing excellence of mechanic or organic power seemed to be superadded at this time and for this service the force of inspiration could any thing therefore be looked for but a glorious result <\s>
<s> the army proved its prowess in the field and what has been the result is attested and long will be attested by the downcast looks the silence the passionate exclamations the sighs and shame of every man who is worthy to breathe the air or to look upon the green fields of liberty in this blessed and highly favoured island which we inhabit <\s>
<s> if i were speaking of things however weighty that were long past and dwindled in the memory i should scarcely venture to use this language but the feelings are of yesterday they are of to day the flower a melancholy flower it is <\s>
<s> is still in blow nor will i trust its leaves be shed through months that are to come for i repeat that the heart of the nation is in this struggle <\s>
<s> this just and necessary war as we have been accustomed to hear it styled from the beginning of the contest in the year 1793 had some time before the treaty of amiens viz <\s>
<s> after the subjugation of switzerland and not till then begun to be regarded by the body of the people as indeed both just and necessary and this justice and necessity were by none more clearly perceived or more feelingly bewailed than by those who had most eagerly opposed the war in its commencement and who continued most bitterly to regret that this nation had ever borne a part in it <\s>
<s> their conduct was herein consistent they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles for though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition <\s>
<s> this spirit the class of persons of whom i have been speaking and i would now be understood as associating them with an immense majority of the people of great britain whose affections notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them were in the former part of the contest for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies this spirit when it became undeniably embodied in the french government they wished in spite of all dangers should be opposed by war because peace was not to be procured without submission which could not but be followed by a communion of which the word of greeting would be on the one part insult and on the other degradation <\s>
<s> the people now wished for war as their rulers had done before because open war between nations is a defined and effectual partition and the sword in the hands of the good and the virtuous is the most intelligible symbol of abhorrence <\s>
<s> it was in order to be preserved from spirit breaking submissions from the guilt of seeming to approve that which they had not the power to prevent and out of a consciousness of the danger that such guilt would otherwise actually steal upon them and that thus by evil communications and participations would be weakened and finally destroyed those moral sensibilities and energies by virtue of which alone their liberties and even their lives could be preserved that the people of great britain determined to encounter all perils which could follow in the train of open resistance there were some and those deservedly of high character in the country who exerted their utmost influence to counteract this resolution nor did they give to it so gentle a name as want of prudence but they boldly termed it blindness and obstinacy <\s>
<s> let them be judged with charity <\s>
<s> but there are promptings of wisdom from the penetralia of human nature which a people can hear though the wisest of their practical statesmen be deaf towards them <\s>
<s> this authentic voice the people of england had heard and obeyed and in opposition to french tyranny growing daily more insatiate and implacable they ranged themselves zealously under their government though they neither forgot nor forgave its transgressions in having first involved them in a war with a people then struggling for its own liberties under a twofold infliction confounded by inbred faction and beleagured by a cruel and imperious external foe <\s>
<s> but these remembrances did not vent themselves in reproaches nor hinder us from being reconciled to our rulers when a change or rather a revolution in circumstances had imposed new duties and in defiance of local and personal clamour it may be safely said that the nation united heart and hand with the government in its resolve to meet the worst rather than stoop its head to receive that which it was felt would not be the garland but the yoke of peace <\s>
<s> yet it was an afflicting alternative and it is not to be denied that the effort if it had the determination wanted the cheerfulness of duty <\s>
<s> our condition savoured too much of a grinding constraint too much of the vassalage of necessity it had too much of fear and therefore of selfishness not to be contemplated in the main with rueful emotion <\s>
<s> we desponded though we did not despair <\s>
<s> in fact a deliberate and preparatory fortitude a sedate and stern melancholy which had no sunshine and was exhilarated only by the lightnings of indignation this was the highest and best state of moral feeling to which the most noble minded among us could attain <\s>
<s> but from the moment of the rising of the people of the pyrenëan peninsula there was a mighty change we were instantaneously animated and from that moment the contest assumed the dignity which it is not in the power of any thing but hope to bestow and if i may dare to transfer language prompted by a revelation of the state of being that admits not of decay or change to the concerns and interests of our transitory planet from that moment this corruptible put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality <\s>
<s> this sudden elevation was on no account more welcome was by nothing more endeared than by the returning sense which accompanied it of inward liberty and choice which gratified our moral yearnings inasmuch as it would give henceforward to our actions as a people an origination and direction unquestionably moral as it was free as it was manifestly in sympathy with the species as it admitted therefore of fluctuations of generous feeling of approbation and of complacency <\s>
<s> we were intellectualized also in proportion we looked backward upon the records of the human race with pride and instead of being afraid we delighted to look forward into futurity <\s>
<s> it was imagined that this new born spirit of resistance rising from the most sacred feelings of the human heart would diffuse itself through many countries and not merely for the distant future but for the present hopes were entertained as bold as they were disinterested and generous <\s>
<s> never indeed was the fellowship of our sentient nature more intimately felt never was the irresistible power of justice more gloriously displayed than when the british and spanish nations with an impulse like that of two ancient heroes throwing down their weapons and reconciled in the field cast off at once their aversions and enmities and mutually embraced each other to solemnize this conversion of love not by the festivities of peace but by combating side by side through danger and under affliction in the devotedness of perfect brotherhood <\s>
<s> this was a conjunction which excited hope as fervent as it was rational <\s>
<s> on the one side was a nation which brought with it sanction and authority inasmuch as it had tried and approved the blessings for which the other had risen to contend the one was a people which by the help of the surrounding ocean and its own virtues had preserved to itself through ages its liberty pure and inviolated by a foreign invader the other a high minded nation which a tyrant presuming on its decrepitude had through the real decrepitude of its government perfidiously enslaved <\s>
<s> what could be more delightful than to think of an intercourse beginning in this manner <\s>
<s> on the part of the spaniards their love towards us was enthusiasm and adoration the faults of our national character were hidden from them by a veil of splendour they saw nothing around us but glory and light and on our side we estimated their character with partial and indulgent fondness thinking on their past greatness not as the undermined foundation of a magnificent building but as the root of a majestic tree recovered from a long disease and beginning again to flourish with promise of wider branches and a deeper shade than it had boasted in the fulness of its strength <\s>
<s> if in the sensations with which the spaniards prostrated themselves before the religion of their country we did not keep pace with them if even their loyalty was such as from our mixed constitution of government and from other causes we could not thoroughly sympathize with and if lastly their devotion to the person of their sovereign appeared to us to have too much of the alloy of delusion in all these things we judged them gently and taught by the reverses of the french revolution we looked upon these dispositions as more human more social and therefore as wiser and of better omen than if they had stood forth the zealots of abstract principles drawn out of the laboratory of unfeeling philosophists <\s>
<s> finally in this reverence for the past and present we found an earnest that they were prepared to contend to the death for as much liberty as their habits and their knowledge enabled them to receive <\s>
<s> to assist them and their neighbours the portugueze in the attainment of this end we sent to them in love and in friendship a powerful army to aid to invigorate and to chastise they landed and the first proof they afforded of their being worthy to be sent on such a service the first pledge of amity given by them was the victory of vimiera the second pledge and this was from the hand of their generals was the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the reader will by this time have perceived what thoughts were uppermost in my mind when i began with asserting that this convention is among the most important events of our times an assertion which was made deliberately and after due allowance for that infirmity which inclines us to magnify things present and passing at the expence of those which are past <\s>
<s> it is my aim to prove wherein the real importance of this event lies and as a necessary preparative for forming a right judgment upon it i have already given a representation of the sentiments with which the people of great britain and those of spain looked upon each other <\s>
<s> i have indeed spoken rather of the spaniards than of the portugueze but what has been said will be understood as applying in the main to the whole peninsula <\s>
<s> the wrongs of the two nations have been equal and their cause is the same they must stand or fall together <\s>
<s> what their wrongs have been in what degree they considered themselves united and what their hopes and resolutions were we have learned from public papers issued by themselves and by their enemies <\s>
<s> these were read by the people of this country at the time when they were severally published with due impression pity that those impressions could not have been as faithfully retained as they were at first received deeply <\s>
<s> doubtless there is not a man in these islands who is not convinced that the cause of spain is the most righteous cause in which since the opposition of the greek republics to the persian invader at thermopylae and marathon sword ever was drawn <\s>
<s> but this is not enough <\s>
<s> we are actors in the struggle and in order that we may have steady principles to controul and direct us without which we may do much harm and can do no good we ought to make it a duty to revive in the memory those words and facts which first carried the conviction to our hearts that as far as it is possible we may see as we then saw and feel as we then felt <\s>
<s> let me therefore entreat the reader seriously to peruse once more such parts of those declarations as i shall extract from them <\s>
<s> i feel indeed with sorrow that events are hurrying us forward as down the rapid of an american river and that there is too much danger before to permit the mind easily to turn back upon the course which is past <\s>
<s> it is indeed difficult but i need not say that to yield to the difficulty would be degrading to rational beings <\s>
<s> besides if from the retrospect we can either gain strength by which we can overcome or learn prudence by which we may avoid such submission is not only degrading but pernicious <\s>
<s> i address these words to those who have feeling but whose judgment is overpowered by their feelings such as have not and who are mere slaves of curiosity calling perpetually for something new and being able to create nothing new for themselves out of old materials may be left to wander about under the yoke of their own unprofitable appetite yet not so <\s>
<s> even these i would include in my request and conjure them as they are men not to be impatient while i place before their eyes a composition made out of fragments of those declarations from various parts of the peninsula which disposed as it were in a tesselated pavement shall set forth a story which may be easily understood which will move and teach and be consolatory to him who looks upon it <\s>
<s> i say consolatory and let not the reader shrink from the word <\s>
<s> i am well aware of the burthen which is to be supported of the discountenance from recent calamity under which every thing which speaks of hope for the spanish people and through them for mankind will be received <\s>
<s> but this far from deterring ought to be an encouragement it makes the duty more imperious <\s>
<s> nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature <\s>
<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>

<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>

<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>

<s> their conduct was herein consistent they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles for though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition <\s>
<s> this spirit the class of persons of whom i have been speaking and i would now be understood as associating them with an immense majority of the people of great britain whose affections notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them were in the former part of the contest for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies this spirit when it became undeniably embodied in the french government they wished in spite of all dangers should be opposed by war because peace was not to be procured without submission which could not but be followed by a communion of which the word of greeting would be on the one part insult and on the other degradation <\s>
<s> the people now wished for war as their rulers had done before because open war between nations is a defined and effectual partition and the sword in the hands of the good and the virtuous is the most intelligible symbol of abhorrence <\s>

<s> let them be judged with charity <\s>
<s> but there are promptings of wisdom from the penetralia of human nature which a people can hear though the wisest of their practical statesmen be deaf towards them <\s>
<s> this authentic voice the people of england had heard and obeyed and in opposition to french tyranny growing daily more insatiate and implacable they ranged themselves zealously under their government though they neither forgot nor forgave its transgressions in having first involved them in a war with a people then struggling for its own liberties under a twofold infliction confounded by inbred faction and beleagured by a cruel and imperious external foe <\s>
<s> but these remembrances did not vent themselves in reproaches nor hinder us from being reconciled to our rulers when a change or rather a revolution in circumstances had imposed new duties and in defiance of local and personal clamour it may be safely said that the nation united heart and hand with the government in its resolve to meet the worst rather than stoop its head to receive that which it was felt would not be the garland but the yoke of peace <\s>
<s> yet it was an afflicting alternative and it is not to be denied that the effort if it had the determination wanted the cheerfulness of duty <\s>
<s> our condition savoured too much of a grinding constraint too much of the vassalage of necessity it had too much of fear and therefore of selfishness not to be contemplated in the main with rueful emotion <\s>
<s> we desponded though we did not despair <\s>
<s> in fact a deliberate and preparatory fortitude a sedate and stern melancholy which had no sunshine and was exhilarated only by the lightnings of indignation this was the highest and best state of moral feeling to which the most noble minded among us could attain <\s>
<s> but from the moment of the rising of the people of the pyrenëan peninsula there was a mighty change we were instantaneously animated and from that moment the contest assumed the dignity which it is not in the power of any thing but hope to bestow and if i may dare to transfer language prompted by a revelation of the state of being that admits not of decay or change to the concerns and interests of our transitory planet from that moment this corruptible put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality <\s>
<s> this sudden elevation was on no account more welcome was by nothing more endeared than by the returning sense which accompanied it of inward liberty and choice which gratified our moral yearnings inasmuch as it would give henceforward to our actions as a people an origination and direction unquestionably moral as it was free as it was manifestly in sympathy with the species as it admitted therefore of fluctuations of generous feeling of approbation and of complacency <\s>
<s> we were intellectualized also in proportion we looked backward upon the records of the human race with pride and instead of being afraid we delighted to look forward into futurity <\s>
<s> it was imagined that this new born spirit of resistance rising from the most sacred feelings of the human heart would diffuse itself through many countries and not merely for the distant future but for the present hopes were entertained as bold as they were disinterested and generous <\s>
<s> never indeed was the fellowship of our sentient nature more intimately felt never was the irresistible power of justice more gloriously displayed than when the british and spanish nations with an impulse like that of two ancient heroes throwing down their weapons and reconciled in the field cast off at once their aversions and enmities and mutually embraced each other to solemnize this conversion of love not by the festivities of peace but by combating side by side through danger and under affliction in the devotedness of perfect brotherhood <\s>
<s> this was a conjunction which excited hope as fervent as it was rational <\s>
<s> on the one side was a nation which brought with it sanction and authority inasmuch as it had tried and approved the blessings for which the other had risen to contend the one was a people which by the help of the surrounding ocean and its own virtues had preserved to itself through ages its liberty pure and inviolated by a foreign invader the other a high minded nation which a tyrant presuming on its decrepitude had through the real decrepitude of its government perfidiously enslaved <\s>
<s> what could be more delightful than to think of an intercourse beginning in this manner <\s>
<s> on the part of the spaniards their love towards us was enthusiasm and adoration the faults of our national character were hidden from them by a veil of splendour they saw nothing around us but glory and light and on our side we estimated their character with partial and indulgent fondness thinking on their past greatness not as the undermined foundation of a magnificent building but as the root of a majestic tree recovered from a long disease and beginning again to flourish with promise of wider branches and a deeper shade than it had boasted in the fulness of its strength <\s>
<s> if in the sensations with which the spaniards prostrated themselves before the religion of their country we did not keep pace with them if even their loyalty was such as from our mixed constitution of government and from other causes we could not thoroughly sympathize with and if lastly their devotion to the person of their sovereign appeared to us to have too much of the alloy of delusion in all these things we judged them gently and taught by the reverses of the french revolution we looked upon these dispositions as more human more social and therefore as wiser and of better omen than if they had stood forth the zealots of abstract principles drawn out of the laboratory of unfeeling philosophists <\s>
<s> finally in this reverence for the past and present we found an earnest that they were prepared to contend to the death for as much liberty as their habits and their knowledge enabled them to receive <\s>
<s> to assist them and their neighbours the portugueze in the attainment of this end we sent to them in love and in friendship a powerful army to aid to invigorate and to chastise they landed and the first proof they afforded of their being worthy to be sent on such a service the first pledge of amity given by them was the victory of vimiera the second pledge and this was from the hand of their generals was the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the reader will by this time have perceived what thoughts were uppermost in my mind when i began with asserting that this convention is among the most important events of our times an assertion which was made deliberately and after due allowance for that infirmity which inclines us to magnify things present and passing at the expence of those which are past <\s>
<s> it is my aim to prove wherein the real importance of this event lies and as a necessary preparative for forming a right judgment upon it i have already given a representation of the sentiments with which the people of great britain and those of spain looked upon each other <\s>
<s> i have indeed spoken rather of the spaniards than of the portugueze but what has been said will be understood as applying in the main to the whole peninsula <\s>
<s> the wrongs of the two nations have been equal and their cause is the same they must stand or fall together <\s>
<s> what their wrongs have been in what degree they considered themselves united and what their hopes and resolutions were we have learned from public papers issued by themselves and by their enemies <\s>
<s> these were read by the people of this country at the time when they were severally published with due impression pity that those impressions could not have been as faithfully retained as they were at first received deeply <\s>
<s> doubtless there is not a man in these islands who is not convinced that the cause of spain is the most righteous cause in which since the opposition of the greek republics to the persian invader at thermopylae and marathon sword ever was drawn <\s>
<s> but this is not enough <\s>
<s> we are actors in the struggle and in order that we may have steady principles to controul and direct us without which we may do much harm and can do no good we ought to make it a duty to revive in the memory those words and facts which first carried the conviction to our hearts that as far as it is possible we may see as we then saw and feel as we then felt <\s>
<s> let me therefore entreat the reader seriously to peruse once more such parts of those declarations as i shall extract from them <\s>
<s> i feel indeed with sorrow that events are hurrying us forward as down the rapid of an american river and that there is too much danger before to permit the mind easily to turn back upon the course which is past <\s>
<s> it is indeed difficult but i need not say that to yield to the difficulty would be degrading to rational beings <\s>
<s> besides if from the retrospect we can either gain strength by which we can overcome or learn prudence by which we may avoid such submission is not only degrading but pernicious <\s>
<s> i address these words to those who have feeling but whose judgment is overpowered by their feelings such as have not and who are mere slaves of curiosity calling perpetually for something new and being able to create nothing new for themselves out of old materials may be left to wander about under the yoke of their own unprofitable appetite yet not so <\s>
<s> even these i would include in my request and conjure them as they are men not to be impatient while i place before their eyes a composition made out of fragments of those declarations from various parts of the peninsula which disposed as it were in a tesselated pavement shall set forth a story which may be easily understood which will move and teach and be consolatory to him who looks upon it <\s>
<s> i say consolatory and let not the reader shrink from the word <\s>
<s> i am well aware of the burthen which is to be supported of the discountenance from recent calamity under which every thing which speaks of hope for the spanish people and through them for mankind will be received <\s>
<s> but this far from deterring ought to be an encouragement it makes the duty more imperious <\s>
<s> nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature <\s>
<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>
<s> for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits <\s>
<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>
<s> yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success <\s>
<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>
<s> may heaven avert from the minds of my countrymen the slightest wish to abolish their constitution <\s>
<s> locke have been overturned by the pride ambition and turbulency of private men by the people's wantonness and desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers as well as by the rulers insolence and endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over the people <\s>
<s> the recent danger to our constitution was in my opinion small for i considered its excellence to be so obvious to men even of the most unimproved understandings that i looked upon it as an idle and fruitless effort either in foreign or domestic incendiaries to endeavour to persuade the bulk of the people to consent to an alteration of it in favour of a republic <\s>
<s> i knew indeed that in every country the flagitious dregs of a nation were always ripe for revolutions but i was sensible at the same time that it was the interest not only of the opulent and powerful not only of the mercantile and middle classes of life but even of honest labourers and manufacturers of every sober and industrious man to resist the licentious principles of such pestilent members shall i call them or outcasts of society <\s>
<s> men better informed and wiser than myself thought that the constitution was in great danger <\s>
<s> whether in fact the danger was great or small it is not necessary now to inquire it may be more useful to declare that in my humble opinion the danger of whatever magnitude it may have been did not originate in any encroachments of either the legislative or executive power on the liberties or properties of the people but in the wild fancies and turbulent tempers of discontented or ill informed individuals <\s>
<s> i sincerely rejoice that through the vigilance of administration this turbulency has received a check <\s>
<s> the hopes of bad men have been disappointed and the understandings of mistaken men have been enlightened by the general and unequivocal judgment of a whole nation a nation not more renowned for its bravery and its humanity though justly celebrated for both than for its loyalty to its princes and what is perfectly consistent with loyalty for its love of liberty and attachment to the constitution <\s>
<s> wise men have formed it brave men have bled for it it is our part to preserve it <\s>
<s> the convention of cintra 1809 <\s>
<s> on the convention of cintra see preface in the present volume <\s>

<s> a politic man may write from his brain without touch and sense of his heart as in a speculation that appertaineth not unto him but a feeling christian will express in his words a character of zeal or love <\s>
<s> the following pages originated in the opposition which was made by his majesty's ministers to the expression in public meetings and otherwise of the opinions and feelings of the people concerning the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> for the sake of immediate and general circulation i determined when i had made a considerable progress in the manuscript to print it in different portions in one of the daily newspapers <\s>
<s> accordingly two portions of it extending to page 25 were printed in the months of december and january in the courier as being one of the most impartial and extensively circulated journals of the time <\s>
<s> the reader is requested to bear in mind this previous publication otherwise he will be at a loss to account for the arrangement of the matter in one instance in the earlier part of the work <\s>
<s> an accidental loss of several sheets of the manuscript delayed the continuance of the publication in that manner till the close of the christmas holidays and the pressure of public business rendering it then improbable that room could be found in the columns of the paper regularly to insert matter extending to such a length this plan of publication was given up <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state that in the extracts which have been made from the spanish proclamations i have been obliged to content myself with the translations which appeared in the public journals having only in one instance had access to the original <\s>
<s> this is in some cases to be regretted where the language falls below the dignity of the matter but in general it is not so and the feeling has suggested correspondent expressions to the translators hastily as no doubt they must have performed their work <\s>
<s> i must entreat the reader to bear in mind that i began to write upon this subject in november last and have continued without bringing my work earlier to a conclusion partly from accident and partly from a wish to possess additional documents and facts <\s>
<s> passing occurrences have made changes in the situation of certain objects spoken of but i have not thought it necessary to accommodate what i had previously written to these changes the whole stands without alteration except where additions have been made or errors corrected <\s>
<s> as i have spoken without reserve of things and of persons as far as it was necessary to illustrate things but no further ); and as this has been uniformly done according to the light of my conscience i have deemed it right to prefix my name to these pages in order that this last testimony of a sincere mind might not be wanting <\s>

<s> for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits <\s>

<s> a politic man may write from his brain without touch and sense of his heart as in a speculation that appertaineth not unto him but a feeling christian will express in his words a character of zeal or love <\s>
<s> the following pages originated in the opposition which was made by his majesty's ministers to the expression in public meetings and otherwise of the opinions and feelings of the people concerning the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> for the sake of immediate and general circulation i determined when i had made a considerable progress in the manuscript to print it in different portions in one of the daily newspapers <\s>
<s> accordingly two portions of it extending to page 25 were printed in the months of december and january in the courier as being one of the most impartial and extensively circulated journals of the time <\s>
<s> the reader is requested to bear in mind this previous publication otherwise he will be at a loss to account for the arrangement of the matter in one instance in the earlier part of the work <\s>
<s> an accidental loss of several sheets of the manuscript delayed the continuance of the publication in that manner till the close of the christmas holidays and the pressure of public business rendering it then improbable that room could be found in the columns of the paper regularly to insert matter extending to such a length this plan of publication was given up <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state that in the extracts which have been made from the spanish proclamations i have been obliged to content myself with the translations which appeared in the public journals having only in one instance had access to the original <\s>
<s> this is in some cases to be regretted where the language falls below the dignity of the matter but in general it is not so and the feeling has suggested correspondent expressions to the translators hastily as no doubt they must have performed their work <\s>
<s> i must entreat the reader to bear in mind that i began to write upon this subject in november last and have continued without bringing my work earlier to a conclusion partly from accident and partly from a wish to possess additional documents and facts <\s>
<s> passing occurrences have made changes in the situation of certain objects spoken of but i have not thought it necessary to accommodate what i had previously written to these changes the whole stands without alteration except where additions have been made or errors corrected <\s>
<s> as i have spoken without reserve of things and of persons as far as it was necessary to illustrate things but no further ); and as this has been uniformly done according to the light of my conscience i have deemed it right to prefix my name to these pages in order that this last testimony of a sincere mind might not be wanting <\s>
<s> concerning the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the convention recently concluded by the generals at the head of the british army in portugal is one of the most important events of our time <\s>
<s> it would be deemed so in france if the ruler of that country could dare to make it public with those merely of its known bearings and dependences with which the english people are acquainted it has been deemed so in spain and portugal as far as the people of those countries have been permitted to gain or have gained a knowledge of it and what this nation has felt and still feels upon the subject is sufficiently manifest <\s>
<s> wherever the tidings were communicated they carried agitation along with them a conflict of sensations in which though sorrow was predominant yet through force of scorn impatience hope and indignation and through the universal participation in passions so complex and the sense of power which this necessarily included the whole partook of the energy and activity of congratulation and joy <\s>
<s> not a street not a public room not a fire side in the island which was not disturbed as by a local or private trouble men of all estates conditions and tempers were affected apparently in equal degrees <\s>
<s> yet was the event by none received as an open and measurable affliction it had indeed features bold and intelligible to every one but there was an under expression which was strange dark and mysterious and accordingly as different notions prevailed or the object was looked at in different points of view we were astonished like men who are overwhelmed without forewarning fearful like men who feel themselves to be helpless and indignant and angry like men who are betrayed <\s>
<s> in a word it would not be too much to say that the tidings of this event did not spread with the commotion of a storm which sweeps visibly over our heads but like an earthquake which rocks the ground under our feet <\s>
<s> how was it possible that it could be otherwise <\s>
<s> for that army had been sent upon a service which appealed so strongly to all that was human in the heart of this nation that there was scarcely a gallant father of a family who had not his moments of regret that he was not a soldier by profession which might have made it his duty to accompany it every high minded youth grieved that his first impulses which would have sent him upon the same errand were not to be yielded to and that after thought did not sanction and confirm the instantaneous dictates or the reiterated persuasions of an heroic spirit <\s>
<s> the army took its departure with prayers and blessings which were as widely spread as they were fervent and intense <\s>
<s> for it was not doubted that on this occasion every person of which it was composed from the general to the private soldier would carry both into his conflicts with the enemy in the field and into his relations of peaceful intercourse with the inhabitants not only the virtues which might be expected from him as a soldier but the antipathies and sympathies the loves and hatreds of a citizen of a human being acting in a manner hitherto unprecedented under the obligation of his human and social nature <\s>
<s> if the conduct of the rapacious and merciless adversary rendered it neither easy nor wise made it i might say impossible to give way to that unqualified admiration of courage and skill made it impossible in relation to him to be exalted by those triumphs of the courteous affections and to be purified by those refinements of civility which do more than any thing reconcile a man of thoughtful mind and humane dispositions to the horrors of ordinary war it was felt that for such loss the benign and accomplished soldier would upon this mission be abundantly recompensed by the enthusiasm of fraternal love with which his ally the oppressed people whom he was going to aid in rescuing themselves would receive him and that this and the virtues which he would witness in them would furnish his heart with never failing and far nobler objects of complacency and admiration <\s>
<s> the discipline of the army was well known and as a machine or a vital organized body the nation was assured that it could not but be formidable but thus to the standing excellence of mechanic or organic power seemed to be superadded at this time and for this service the force of inspiration could any thing therefore be looked for but a glorious result <\s>
<s> the army proved its prowess in the field and what has been the result is attested and long will be attested by the downcast looks the silence the passionate exclamations the sighs and shame of every man who is worthy to breathe the air or to look upon the green fields of liberty in this blessed and highly favoured island which we inhabit <\s>
<s> if i were speaking of things however weighty that were long past and dwindled in the memory i should scarcely venture to use this language but the feelings are of yesterday they are of to day the flower a melancholy flower it is <\s>
<s> is still in blow nor will i trust its leaves be shed through months that are to come for i repeat that the heart of the nation is in this struggle <\s>
<s> this just and necessary war as we have been accustomed to hear it styled from the beginning of the contest in the year 1793 had some time before the treaty of amiens viz <\s>
<s> after the subjugation of switzerland and not till then begun to be regarded by the body of the people as indeed both just and necessary and this justice and necessity were by none more clearly perceived or more feelingly bewailed than by those who had most eagerly opposed the war in its commencement and who continued most bitterly to regret that this nation had ever borne a part in it <\s>
<s> their conduct was herein consistent they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles for though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition <\s>
<s> this spirit the class of persons of whom i have been speaking and i would now be understood as associating them with an immense majority of the people of great britain whose affections notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them were in the former part of the contest for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies this spirit when it became undeniably embodied in the french government they wished in spite of all dangers should be opposed by war because peace was not to be procured without submission which could not but be followed by a communion of which the word of greeting would be on the one part insult and on the other degradation <\s>
<s> the people now wished for war as their rulers had done before because open war between nations is a defined and effectual partition and the sword in the hands of the good and the virtuous is the most intelligible symbol of abhorrence <\s>
<s> it was in order to be preserved from spirit breaking submissions from the guilt of seeming to approve that which they had not the power to prevent and out of a consciousness of the danger that such guilt would otherwise actually steal upon them and that thus by evil communications and participations would be weakened and finally destroyed those moral sensibilities and energies by virtue of which alone their liberties and even their lives could be preserved that the people of great britain determined to encounter all perils which could follow in the train of open resistance there were some and those deservedly of high character in the country who exerted their utmost influence to counteract this resolution nor did they give to it so gentle a name as want of prudence but they boldly termed it blindness and obstinacy <\s>
<s> let them be judged with charity <\s>
<s> but there are promptings of wisdom from the penetralia of human nature which a people can hear though the wisest of their practical statesmen be deaf towards them <\s>
<s> this authentic voice the people of england had heard and obeyed and in opposition to french tyranny growing daily more insatiate and implacable they ranged themselves zealously under their government though they neither forgot nor forgave its transgressions in having first involved them in a war with a people then struggling for its own liberties under a twofold infliction confounded by inbred faction and beleagured by a cruel and imperious external foe <\s>
<s> but these remembrances did not vent themselves in reproaches nor hinder us from being reconciled to our rulers when a change or rather a revolution in circumstances had imposed new duties and in defiance of local and personal clamour it may be safely said that the nation united heart and hand with the government in its resolve to meet the worst rather than stoop its head to receive that which it was felt would not be the garland but the yoke of peace <\s>
<s> yet it was an afflicting alternative and it is not to be denied that the effort if it had the determination wanted the cheerfulness of duty <\s>
<s> our condition savoured too much of a grinding constraint too much of the vassalage of necessity it had too much of fear and therefore of selfishness not to be contemplated in the main with rueful emotion <\s>
<s> we desponded though we did not despair <\s>
<s> in fact a deliberate and preparatory fortitude a sedate and stern melancholy which had no sunshine and was exhilarated only by the lightnings of indignation this was the highest and best state of moral feeling to which the most noble minded among us could attain <\s>
<s> but from the moment of the rising of the people of the pyrenëan peninsula there was a mighty change we were instantaneously animated and from that moment the contest assumed the dignity which it is not in the power of any thing but hope to bestow and if i may dare to transfer language prompted by a revelation of the state of being that admits not of decay or change to the concerns and interests of our transitory planet from that moment this corruptible put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality <\s>
<s> this sudden elevation was on no account more welcome was by nothing more endeared than by the returning sense which accompanied it of inward liberty and choice which gratified our moral yearnings inasmuch as it would give henceforward to our actions as a people an origination and direction unquestionably moral as it was free as it was manifestly in sympathy with the species as it admitted therefore of fluctuations of generous feeling of approbation and of complacency <\s>
<s> we were intellectualized also in proportion we looked backward upon the records of the human race with pride and instead of being afraid we delighted to look forward into futurity <\s>
<s> it was imagined that this new born spirit of resistance rising from the most sacred feelings of the human heart would diffuse itself through many countries and not merely for the distant future but for the present hopes were entertained as bold as they were disinterested and generous <\s>
<s> never indeed was the fellowship of our sentient nature more intimately felt never was the irresistible power of justice more gloriously displayed than when the british and spanish nations with an impulse like that of two ancient heroes throwing down their weapons and reconciled in the field cast off at once their aversions and enmities and mutually embraced each other to solemnize this conversion of love not by the festivities of peace but by combating side by side through danger and under affliction in the devotedness of perfect brotherhood <\s>
<s> this was a conjunction which excited hope as fervent as it was rational <\s>
<s> on the one side was a nation which brought with it sanction and authority inasmuch as it had tried and approved the blessings for which the other had risen to contend the one was a people which by the help of the surrounding ocean and its own virtues had preserved to itself through ages its liberty pure and inviolated by a foreign invader the other a high minded nation which a tyrant presuming on its decrepitude had through the real decrepitude of its government perfidiously enslaved <\s>

<s> not a street not a public room not a fire side in the island which was not disturbed as by a local or private trouble men of all estates conditions and tempers were affected apparently in equal degrees <\s>
<s> yet was the event by none received as an open and measurable affliction it had indeed features bold and intelligible to every one but there was an under expression which was strange dark and mysterious and accordingly as different notions prevailed or the object was looked at in different points of view we were astonished like men who are overwhelmed without forewarning fearful like men who feel themselves to be helpless and indignant and angry like men who are betrayed <\s>
<s> in a word it would not be too much to say that the tidings of this event did not spread with the commotion of a storm which sweeps visibly over our heads but like an earthquake which rocks the ground under our feet <\s>
<s> how was it possible that it could be otherwise <\s>
<s> for that army had been sent upon a service which appealed so strongly to all that was human in the heart of this nation that there was scarcely a gallant father of a family who had not his moments of regret that he was not a soldier by profession which might have made it his duty to accompany it every high minded youth grieved that his first impulses which would have sent him upon the same errand were not to be yielded to and that after thought did not sanction and confirm the instantaneous dictates or the reiterated persuasions of an heroic spirit <\s>
<s> the army took its departure with prayers and blessings which were as widely spread as they were fervent and intense <\s>
<s> for it was not doubted that on this occasion every person of which it was composed from the general to the private soldier would carry both into his conflicts with the enemy in the field and into his relations of peaceful intercourse with the inhabitants not only the virtues which might be expected from him as a soldier but the antipathies and sympathies the loves and hatreds of a citizen of a human being acting in a manner hitherto unprecedented under the obligation of his human and social nature <\s>
<s> if the conduct of the rapacious and merciless adversary rendered it neither easy nor wise made it i might say impossible to give way to that unqualified admiration of courage and skill made it impossible in relation to him to be exalted by those triumphs of the courteous affections and to be purified by those refinements of civility which do more than any thing reconcile a man of thoughtful mind and humane dispositions to the horrors of ordinary war it was felt that for such loss the benign and accomplished soldier would upon this mission be abundantly recompensed by the enthusiasm of fraternal love with which his ally the oppressed people whom he was going to aid in rescuing themselves would receive him and that this and the virtues which he would witness in them would furnish his heart with never failing and far nobler objects of complacency and admiration <\s>
<s> the discipline of the army was well known and as a machine or a vital organized body the nation was assured that it could not but be formidable but thus to the standing excellence of mechanic or organic power seemed to be superadded at this time and for this service the force of inspiration could any thing therefore be looked for but a glorious result <\s>
<s> the army proved its prowess in the field and what has been the result is attested and long will be attested by the downcast looks the silence the passionate exclamations the sighs and shame of every man who is worthy to breathe the air or to look upon the green fields of liberty in this blessed and highly favoured island which we inhabit <\s>
<s> if i were speaking of things however weighty that were long past and dwindled in the memory i should scarcely venture to use this language but the feelings are of yesterday they are of to day the flower a melancholy flower it is <\s>
<s> is still in blow nor will i trust its leaves be shed through months that are to come for i repeat that the heart of the nation is in this struggle <\s>
<s> this just and necessary war as we have been accustomed to hear it styled from the beginning of the contest in the year 1793 had some time before the treaty of amiens viz <\s>
<s> after the subjugation of switzerland and not till then begun to be regarded by the body of the people as indeed both just and necessary and this justice and necessity were by none more clearly perceived or more feelingly bewailed than by those who had most eagerly opposed the war in its commencement and who continued most bitterly to regret that this nation had ever borne a part in it <\s>
<s> their conduct was herein consistent they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles for though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition <\s>
<s> this spirit the class of persons of whom i have been speaking and i would now be understood as associating them with an immense majority of the people of great britain whose affections notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them were in the former part of the contest for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies this spirit when it became undeniably embodied in the french government they wished in spite of all dangers should be opposed by war because peace was not to be procured without submission which could not but be followed by a communion of which the word of greeting would be on the one part insult and on the other degradation <\s>
<s> the people now wished for war as their rulers had done before because open war between nations is a defined and effectual partition and the sword in the hands of the good and the virtuous is the most intelligible symbol of abhorrence <\s>
<s> it was in order to be preserved from spirit breaking submissions from the guilt of seeming to approve that which they had not the power to prevent and out of a consciousness of the danger that such guilt would otherwise actually steal upon them and that thus by evil communications and participations would be weakened and finally destroyed those moral sensibilities and energies by virtue of which alone their liberties and even their lives could be preserved that the people of great britain determined to encounter all perils which could follow in the train of open resistance there were some and those deservedly of high character in the country who exerted their utmost influence to counteract this resolution nor did they give to it so gentle a name as want of prudence but they boldly termed it blindness and obstinacy <\s>
<s> let them be judged with charity <\s>
<s> but there are promptings of wisdom from the penetralia of human nature which a people can hear though the wisest of their practical statesmen be deaf towards them <\s>
<s> this authentic voice the people of england had heard and obeyed and in opposition to french tyranny growing daily more insatiate and implacable they ranged themselves zealously under their government though they neither forgot nor forgave its transgressions in having first involved them in a war with a people then struggling for its own liberties under a twofold infliction confounded by inbred faction and beleagured by a cruel and imperious external foe <\s>
<s> but these remembrances did not vent themselves in reproaches nor hinder us from being reconciled to our rulers when a change or rather a revolution in circumstances had imposed new duties and in defiance of local and personal clamour it may be safely said that the nation united heart and hand with the government in its resolve to meet the worst rather than stoop its head to receive that which it was felt would not be the garland but the yoke of peace <\s>
<s> yet it was an afflicting alternative and it is not to be denied that the effort if it had the determination wanted the cheerfulness of duty <\s>
<s> our condition savoured too much of a grinding constraint too much of the vassalage of necessity it had too much of fear and therefore of selfishness not to be contemplated in the main with rueful emotion <\s>
<s> we desponded though we did not despair <\s>
<s> in fact a deliberate and preparatory fortitude a sedate and stern melancholy which had no sunshine and was exhilarated only by the lightnings of indignation this was the highest and best state of moral feeling to which the most noble minded among us could attain <\s>
<s> but from the moment of the rising of the people of the pyrenëan peninsula there was a mighty change we were instantaneously animated and from that moment the contest assumed the dignity which it is not in the power of any thing but hope to bestow and if i may dare to transfer language prompted by a revelation of the state of being that admits not of decay or change to the concerns and interests of our transitory planet from that moment this corruptible put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality <\s>
<s> this sudden elevation was on no account more welcome was by nothing more endeared than by the returning sense which accompanied it of inward liberty and choice which gratified our moral yearnings inasmuch as it would give henceforward to our actions as a people an origination and direction unquestionably moral as it was free as it was manifestly in sympathy with the species as it admitted therefore of fluctuations of generous feeling of approbation and of complacency <\s>
<s> we were intellectualized also in proportion we looked backward upon the records of the human race with pride and instead of being afraid we delighted to look forward into futurity <\s>
<s> it was imagined that this new born spirit of resistance rising from the most sacred feelings of the human heart would diffuse itself through many countries and not merely for the distant future but for the present hopes were entertained as bold as they were disinterested and generous <\s>
<s> never indeed was the fellowship of our sentient nature more intimately felt never was the irresistible power of justice more gloriously displayed than when the british and spanish nations with an impulse like that of two ancient heroes throwing down their weapons and reconciled in the field cast off at once their aversions and enmities and mutually embraced each other to solemnize this conversion of love not by the festivities of peace but by combating side by side through danger and under affliction in the devotedness of perfect brotherhood <\s>
<s> this was a conjunction which excited hope as fervent as it was rational <\s>
<s> on the one side was a nation which brought with it sanction and authority inasmuch as it had tried and approved the blessings for which the other had risen to contend the one was a people which by the help of the surrounding ocean and its own virtues had preserved to itself through ages its liberty pure and inviolated by a foreign invader the other a high minded nation which a tyrant presuming on its decrepitude had through the real decrepitude of its government perfidiously enslaved <\s>
<s> what could be more delightful than to think of an intercourse beginning in this manner <\s>
<s> on the part of the spaniards their love towards us was enthusiasm and adoration the faults of our national character were hidden from them by a veil of splendour they saw nothing around us but glory and light and on our side we estimated their character with partial and indulgent fondness thinking on their past greatness not as the undermined foundation of a magnificent building but as the root of a majestic tree recovered from a long disease and beginning again to flourish with promise of wider branches and a deeper shade than it had boasted in the fulness of its strength <\s>
<s> if in the sensations with which the spaniards prostrated themselves before the religion of their country we did not keep pace with them if even their loyalty was such as from our mixed constitution of government and from other causes we could not thoroughly sympathize with and if lastly their devotion to the person of their sovereign appeared to us to have too much of the alloy of delusion in all these things we judged them gently and taught by the reverses of the french revolution we looked upon these dispositions as more human more social and therefore as wiser and of better omen than if they had stood forth the zealots of abstract principles drawn out of the laboratory of unfeeling philosophists <\s>
<s> finally in this reverence for the past and present we found an earnest that they were prepared to contend to the death for as much liberty as their habits and their knowledge enabled them to receive <\s>
<s> to assist them and their neighbours the portugueze in the attainment of this end we sent to them in love and in friendship a powerful army to aid to invigorate and to chastise they landed and the first proof they afforded of their being worthy to be sent on such a service the first pledge of amity given by them was the victory of vimiera the second pledge and this was from the hand of their generals was the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the reader will by this time have perceived what thoughts were uppermost in my mind when i began with asserting that this convention is among the most important events of our times an assertion which was made deliberately and after due allowance for that infirmity which inclines us to magnify things present and passing at the expence of those which are past <\s>
<s> it is my aim to prove wherein the real importance of this event lies and as a necessary preparative for forming a right judgment upon it i have already given a representation of the sentiments with which the people of great britain and those of spain looked upon each other <\s>
<s> i have indeed spoken rather of the spaniards than of the portugueze but what has been said will be understood as applying in the main to the whole peninsula <\s>
<s> the wrongs of the two nations have been equal and their cause is the same they must stand or fall together <\s>
<s> what their wrongs have been in what degree they considered themselves united and what their hopes and resolutions were we have learned from public papers issued by themselves and by their enemies <\s>
<s> these were read by the people of this country at the time when they were severally published with due impression pity that those impressions could not have been as faithfully retained as they were at first received deeply <\s>
<s> doubtless there is not a man in these islands who is not convinced that the cause of spain is the most righteous cause in which since the opposition of the greek republics to the persian invader at thermopylae and marathon sword ever was drawn <\s>
<s> but this is not enough <\s>
<s> we are actors in the struggle and in order that we may have steady principles to controul and direct us without which we may do much harm and can do no good we ought to make it a duty to revive in the memory those words and facts which first carried the conviction to our hearts that as far as it is possible we may see as we then saw and feel as we then felt <\s>
<s> let me therefore entreat the reader seriously to peruse once more such parts of those declarations as i shall extract from them <\s>
<s> i feel indeed with sorrow that events are hurrying us forward as down the rapid of an american river and that there is too much danger before to permit the mind easily to turn back upon the course which is past <\s>
<s> it is indeed difficult but i need not say that to yield to the difficulty would be degrading to rational beings <\s>
<s> besides if from the retrospect we can either gain strength by which we can overcome or learn prudence by which we may avoid such submission is not only degrading but pernicious <\s>
<s> i address these words to those who have feeling but whose judgment is overpowered by their feelings such as have not and who are mere slaves of curiosity calling perpetually for something new and being able to create nothing new for themselves out of old materials may be left to wander about under the yoke of their own unprofitable appetite yet not so <\s>
<s> even these i would include in my request and conjure them as they are men not to be impatient while i place before their eyes a composition made out of fragments of those declarations from various parts of the peninsula which disposed as it were in a tesselated pavement shall set forth a story which may be easily understood which will move and teach and be consolatory to him who looks upon it <\s>
<s> i say consolatory and let not the reader shrink from the word <\s>
<s> i am well aware of the burthen which is to be supported of the discountenance from recent calamity under which every thing which speaks of hope for the spanish people and through them for mankind will be received <\s>
<s> but this far from deterring ought to be an encouragement it makes the duty more imperious <\s>
<s> nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature <\s>
<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>
<s> for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits <\s>
<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>
<s> yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success <\s>
<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>
<s> may heaven avert from the minds of my countrymen the slightest wish to abolish their constitution <\s>
<s> locke have been overturned by the pride ambition and turbulency of private men by the people's wantonness and desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers as well as by the rulers insolence and endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over the people <\s>
<s> the recent danger to our constitution was in my opinion small for i considered its excellence to be so obvious to men even of the most unimproved understandings that i looked upon it as an idle and fruitless effort either in foreign or domestic incendiaries to endeavour to persuade the bulk of the people to consent to an alteration of it in favour of a republic <\s>
<s> i knew indeed that in every country the flagitious dregs of a nation were always ripe for revolutions but i was sensible at the same time that it was the interest not only of the opulent and powerful not only of the mercantile and middle classes of life but even of honest labourers and manufacturers of every sober and industrious man to resist the licentious principles of such pestilent members shall i call them or outcasts of society <\s>
<s> men better informed and wiser than myself thought that the constitution was in great danger <\s>
<s> whether in fact the danger was great or small it is not necessary now to inquire it may be more useful to declare that in my humble opinion the danger of whatever magnitude it may have been did not originate in any encroachments of either the legislative or executive power on the liberties or properties of the people but in the wild fancies and turbulent tempers of discontented or ill informed individuals <\s>
<s> i sincerely rejoice that through the vigilance of administration this turbulency has received a check <\s>
<s> the hopes of bad men have been disappointed and the understandings of mistaken men have been enlightened by the general and unequivocal judgment of a whole nation a nation not more renowned for its bravery and its humanity though justly celebrated for both than for its loyalty to its princes and what is perfectly consistent with loyalty for its love of liberty and attachment to the constitution <\s>

<s> let me therefore entreat the reader seriously to peruse once more such parts of those declarations as i shall extract from them <\s>
<s> i feel indeed with sorrow that events are hurrying us forward as down the rapid of an american river and that there is too much danger before to permit the mind easily to turn back upon the course which is past <\s>

<s> even these i would include in my request and conjure them as they are men not to be impatient while i place before their eyes a composition made out of fragments of those declarations from various parts of the peninsula which disposed as it were in a tesselated pavement shall set forth a story which may be easily understood which will move and teach and be consolatory to him who looks upon it <\s>
<s> i say consolatory and let not the reader shrink from the word <\s>
<s> i am well aware of the burthen which is to be supported of the discountenance from recent calamity under which every thing which speaks of hope for the spanish people and through them for mankind will be received <\s>
<s> but this far from deterring ought to be an encouragement it makes the duty more imperious <\s>
<s> nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature <\s>
<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>
<s> for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits <\s>
<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>
<s> yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success <\s>
<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>
<s> may heaven avert from the minds of my countrymen the slightest wish to abolish their constitution <\s>
<s> locke have been overturned by the pride ambition and turbulency of private men by the people's wantonness and desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers as well as by the rulers insolence and endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over the people <\s>
<s> the recent danger to our constitution was in my opinion small for i considered its excellence to be so obvious to men even of the most unimproved understandings that i looked upon it as an idle and fruitless effort either in foreign or domestic incendiaries to endeavour to persuade the bulk of the people to consent to an alteration of it in favour of a republic <\s>
<s> i knew indeed that in every country the flagitious dregs of a nation were always ripe for revolutions but i was sensible at the same time that it was the interest not only of the opulent and powerful not only of the mercantile and middle classes of life but even of honest labourers and manufacturers of every sober and industrious man to resist the licentious principles of such pestilent members shall i call them or outcasts of society <\s>
<s> men better informed and wiser than myself thought that the constitution was in great danger <\s>
<s> whether in fact the danger was great or small it is not necessary now to inquire it may be more useful to declare that in my humble opinion the danger of whatever magnitude it may have been did not originate in any encroachments of either the legislative or executive power on the liberties or properties of the people but in the wild fancies and turbulent tempers of discontented or ill informed individuals <\s>
<s> i sincerely rejoice that through the vigilance of administration this turbulency has received a check <\s>
<s> the hopes of bad men have been disappointed and the understandings of mistaken men have been enlightened by the general and unequivocal judgment of a whole nation a nation not more renowned for its bravery and its humanity though justly celebrated for both than for its loyalty to its princes and what is perfectly consistent with loyalty for its love of liberty and attachment to the constitution <\s>

<s> bitter and earnest writing must not hastily be condemned for men cannot contend coldly and without affection about things which they hold dear and precious <\s>
<s> a politic man may write from his brain without touch and sense of his heart as in a speculation that appertaineth not unto him but a feeling christian will express in his words a character of zeal or love <\s>
<s> the following pages originated in the opposition which was made by his majesty's ministers to the expression in public meetings and otherwise of the opinions and feelings of the people concerning the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> for the sake of immediate and general circulation i determined when i had made a considerable progress in the manuscript to print it in different portions in one of the daily newspapers <\s>
<s> accordingly two portions of it extending to page 25 were printed in the months of december and january in the courier as being one of the most impartial and extensively circulated journals of the time <\s>
<s> the reader is requested to bear in mind this previous publication otherwise he will be at a loss to account for the arrangement of the matter in one instance in the earlier part of the work <\s>
<s> an accidental loss of several sheets of the manuscript delayed the continuance of the publication in that manner till the close of the christmas holidays and the pressure of public business rendering it then improbable that room could be found in the columns of the paper regularly to insert matter extending to such a length this plan of publication was given up <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state that in the extracts which have been made from the spanish proclamations i have been obliged to content myself with the translations which appeared in the public journals having only in one instance had access to the original <\s>
<s> this is in some cases to be regretted where the language falls below the dignity of the matter but in general it is not so and the feeling has suggested correspondent expressions to the translators hastily as no doubt they must have performed their work <\s>
<s> i must entreat the reader to bear in mind that i began to write upon this subject in november last and have continued without bringing my work earlier to a conclusion partly from accident and partly from a wish to possess additional documents and facts <\s>
<s> passing occurrences have made changes in the situation of certain objects spoken of but i have not thought it necessary to accommodate what i had previously written to these changes the whole stands without alteration except where additions have been made or errors corrected <\s>
<s> as i have spoken without reserve of things and of persons as far as it was necessary to illustrate things but no further ); and as this has been uniformly done according to the light of my conscience i have deemed it right to prefix my name to these pages in order that this last testimony of a sincere mind might not be wanting <\s>
<s> concerning the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the convention recently concluded by the generals at the head of the british army in portugal is one of the most important events of our time <\s>
<s> it would be deemed so in france if the ruler of that country could dare to make it public with those merely of its known bearings and dependences with which the english people are acquainted it has been deemed so in spain and portugal as far as the people of those countries have been permitted to gain or have gained a knowledge of it and what this nation has felt and still feels upon the subject is sufficiently manifest <\s>
<s> wherever the tidings were communicated they carried agitation along with them a conflict of sensations in which though sorrow was predominant yet through force of scorn impatience hope and indignation and through the universal participation in passions so complex and the sense of power which this necessarily included the whole partook of the energy and activity of congratulation and joy <\s>
<s> not a street not a public room not a fire side in the island which was not disturbed as by a local or private trouble men of all estates conditions and tempers were affected apparently in equal degrees <\s>
<s> yet was the event by none received as an open and measurable affliction it had indeed features bold and intelligible to every one but there was an under expression which was strange dark and mysterious and accordingly as different notions prevailed or the object was looked at in different points of view we were astonished like men who are overwhelmed without forewarning fearful like men who feel themselves to be helpless and indignant and angry like men who are betrayed <\s>
<s> in a word it would not be too much to say that the tidings of this event did not spread with the commotion of a storm which sweeps visibly over our heads but like an earthquake which rocks the ground under our feet <\s>
<s> how was it possible that it could be otherwise <\s>
<s> for that army had been sent upon a service which appealed so strongly to all that was human in the heart of this nation that there was scarcely a gallant father of a family who had not his moments of regret that he was not a soldier by profession which might have made it his duty to accompany it every high minded youth grieved that his first impulses which would have sent him upon the same errand were not to be yielded to and that after thought did not sanction and confirm the instantaneous dictates or the reiterated persuasions of an heroic spirit <\s>
<s> the army took its departure with prayers and blessings which were as widely spread as they were fervent and intense <\s>
<s> for it was not doubted that on this occasion every person of which it was composed from the general to the private soldier would carry both into his conflicts with the enemy in the field and into his relations of peaceful intercourse with the inhabitants not only the virtues which might be expected from him as a soldier but the antipathies and sympathies the loves and hatreds of a citizen of a human being acting in a manner hitherto unprecedented under the obligation of his human and social nature <\s>
<s> if the conduct of the rapacious and merciless adversary rendered it neither easy nor wise made it i might say impossible to give way to that unqualified admiration of courage and skill made it impossible in relation to him to be exalted by those triumphs of the courteous affections and to be purified by those refinements of civility which do more than any thing reconcile a man of thoughtful mind and humane dispositions to the horrors of ordinary war it was felt that for such loss the benign and accomplished soldier would upon this mission be abundantly recompensed by the enthusiasm of fraternal love with which his ally the oppressed people whom he was going to aid in rescuing themselves would receive him and that this and the virtues which he would witness in them would furnish his heart with never failing and far nobler objects of complacency and admiration <\s>
<s> the discipline of the army was well known and as a machine or a vital organized body the nation was assured that it could not but be formidable but thus to the standing excellence of mechanic or organic power seemed to be superadded at this time and for this service the force of inspiration could any thing therefore be looked for but a glorious result <\s>
<s> the army proved its prowess in the field and what has been the result is attested and long will be attested by the downcast looks the silence the passionate exclamations the sighs and shame of every man who is worthy to breathe the air or to look upon the green fields of liberty in this blessed and highly favoured island which we inhabit <\s>
<s> if i were speaking of things however weighty that were long past and dwindled in the memory i should scarcely venture to use this language but the feelings are of yesterday they are of to day the flower a melancholy flower it is <\s>
<s> is still in blow nor will i trust its leaves be shed through months that are to come for i repeat that the heart of the nation is in this struggle <\s>
<s> this just and necessary war as we have been accustomed to hear it styled from the beginning of the contest in the year 1793 had some time before the treaty of amiens viz <\s>
<s> after the subjugation of switzerland and not till then begun to be regarded by the body of the people as indeed both just and necessary and this justice and necessity were by none more clearly perceived or more feelingly bewailed than by those who had most eagerly opposed the war in its commencement and who continued most bitterly to regret that this nation had ever borne a part in it <\s>
<s> their conduct was herein consistent they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles for though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition <\s>
<s> this spirit the class of persons of whom i have been speaking and i would now be understood as associating them with an immense majority of the people of great britain whose affections notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them were in the former part of the contest for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies this spirit when it became undeniably embodied in the french government they wished in spite of all dangers should be opposed by war because peace was not to be procured without submission which could not but be followed by a communion of which the word of greeting would be on the one part insult and on the other degradation <\s>

<s> nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature <\s>
<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>
<s> for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits <\s>
<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>
<s> yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success <\s>
<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>
<s> may heaven avert from the minds of my countrymen the slightest wish to abolish their constitution <\s>
<s> locke have been overturned by the pride ambition and turbulency of private men by the people's wantonness and desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers as well as by the rulers insolence and endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over the people <\s>
<s> the recent danger to our constitution was in my opinion small for i considered its excellence to be so obvious to men even of the most unimproved understandings that i looked upon it as an idle and fruitless effort either in foreign or domestic incendiaries to endeavour to persuade the bulk of the people to consent to an alteration of it in favour of a republic <\s>
<s> i knew indeed that in every country the flagitious dregs of a nation were always ripe for revolutions but i was sensible at the same time that it was the interest not only of the opulent and powerful not only of the mercantile and middle classes of life but even of honest labourers and manufacturers of every sober and industrious man to resist the licentious principles of such pestilent members shall i call them or outcasts of society <\s>

<s> whether in fact the danger was great or small it is not necessary now to inquire it may be more useful to declare that in my humble opinion the danger of whatever magnitude it may have been did not originate in any encroachments of either the legislative or executive power on the liberties or properties of the people but in the wild fancies and turbulent tempers of discontented or ill informed individuals <\s>

<s> concerning the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the convention recently concluded by the generals at the head of the british army in portugal is one of the most important events of our time <\s>
<s> it would be deemed so in france if the ruler of that country could dare to make it public with those merely of its known bearings and dependences with which the english people are acquainted it has been deemed so in spain and portugal as far as the people of those countries have been permitted to gain or have gained a knowledge of it and what this nation has felt and still feels upon the subject is sufficiently manifest <\s>
<s> wherever the tidings were communicated they carried agitation along with them a conflict of sensations in which though sorrow was predominant yet through force of scorn impatience hope and indignation and through the universal participation in passions so complex and the sense of power which this necessarily included the whole partook of the energy and activity of congratulation and joy <\s>
<s> not a street not a public room not a fire side in the island which was not disturbed as by a local or private trouble men of all estates conditions and tempers were affected apparently in equal degrees <\s>
<s> yet was the event by none received as an open and measurable affliction it had indeed features bold and intelligible to every one but there was an under expression which was strange dark and mysterious and accordingly as different notions prevailed or the object was looked at in different points of view we were astonished like men who are overwhelmed without forewarning fearful like men who feel themselves to be helpless and indignant and angry like men who are betrayed <\s>
<s> in a word it would not be too much to say that the tidings of this event did not spread with the commotion of a storm which sweeps visibly over our heads but like an earthquake which rocks the ground under our feet <\s>
<s> how was it possible that it could be otherwise <\s>
<s> for that army had been sent upon a service which appealed so strongly to all that was human in the heart of this nation that there was scarcely a gallant father of a family who had not his moments of regret that he was not a soldier by profession which might have made it his duty to accompany it every high minded youth grieved that his first impulses which would have sent him upon the same errand were not to be yielded to and that after thought did not sanction and confirm the instantaneous dictates or the reiterated persuasions of an heroic spirit <\s>
<s> the army took its departure with prayers and blessings which were as widely spread as they were fervent and intense <\s>
<s> for it was not doubted that on this occasion every person of which it was composed from the general to the private soldier would carry both into his conflicts with the enemy in the field and into his relations of peaceful intercourse with the inhabitants not only the virtues which might be expected from him as a soldier but the antipathies and sympathies the loves and hatreds of a citizen of a human being acting in a manner hitherto unprecedented under the obligation of his human and social nature <\s>
<s> if the conduct of the rapacious and merciless adversary rendered it neither easy nor wise made it i might say impossible to give way to that unqualified admiration of courage and skill made it impossible in relation to him to be exalted by those triumphs of the courteous affections and to be purified by those refinements of civility which do more than any thing reconcile a man of thoughtful mind and humane dispositions to the horrors of ordinary war it was felt that for such loss the benign and accomplished soldier would upon this mission be abundantly recompensed by the enthusiasm of fraternal love with which his ally the oppressed people whom he was going to aid in rescuing themselves would receive him and that this and the virtues which he would witness in them would furnish his heart with never failing and far nobler objects of complacency and admiration <\s>
<s> the discipline of the army was well known and as a machine or a vital organized body the nation was assured that it could not but be formidable but thus to the standing excellence of mechanic or organic power seemed to be superadded at this time and for this service the force of inspiration could any thing therefore be looked for but a glorious result <\s>
<s> the army proved its prowess in the field and what has been the result is attested and long will be attested by the downcast looks the silence the passionate exclamations the sighs and shame of every man who is worthy to breathe the air or to look upon the green fields of liberty in this blessed and highly favoured island which we inhabit <\s>
<s> if i were speaking of things however weighty that were long past and dwindled in the memory i should scarcely venture to use this language but the feelings are of yesterday they are of to day the flower a melancholy flower it is <\s>
<s> is still in blow nor will i trust its leaves be shed through months that are to come for i repeat that the heart of the nation is in this struggle <\s>
<s> this just and necessary war as we have been accustomed to hear it styled from the beginning of the contest in the year 1793 had some time before the treaty of amiens viz <\s>
<s> after the subjugation of switzerland and not till then begun to be regarded by the body of the people as indeed both just and necessary and this justice and necessity were by none more clearly perceived or more feelingly bewailed than by those who had most eagerly opposed the war in its commencement and who continued most bitterly to regret that this nation had ever borne a part in it <\s>
<s> their conduct was herein consistent they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles for though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition <\s>
<s> this spirit the class of persons of whom i have been speaking and i would now be understood as associating them with an immense majority of the people of great britain whose affections notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them were in the former part of the contest for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies this spirit when it became undeniably embodied in the french government they wished in spite of all dangers should be opposed by war because peace was not to be procured without submission which could not but be followed by a communion of which the word of greeting would be on the one part insult and on the other degradation <\s>
<s> the people now wished for war as their rulers had done before because open war between nations is a defined and effectual partition and the sword in the hands of the good and the virtuous is the most intelligible symbol of abhorrence <\s>
<s> it was in order to be preserved from spirit breaking submissions from the guilt of seeming to approve that which they had not the power to prevent and out of a consciousness of the danger that such guilt would otherwise actually steal upon them and that thus by evil communications and participations would be weakened and finally destroyed those moral sensibilities and energies by virtue of which alone their liberties and even their lives could be preserved that the people of great britain determined to encounter all perils which could follow in the train of open resistance there were some and those deservedly of high character in the country who exerted their utmost influence to counteract this resolution nor did they give to it so gentle a name as want of prudence but they boldly termed it blindness and obstinacy <\s>
<s> let them be judged with charity <\s>
<s> but there are promptings of wisdom from the penetralia of human nature which a people can hear though the wisest of their practical statesmen be deaf towards them <\s>
<s> this authentic voice the people of england had heard and obeyed and in opposition to french tyranny growing daily more insatiate and implacable they ranged themselves zealously under their government though they neither forgot nor forgave its transgressions in having first involved them in a war with a people then struggling for its own liberties under a twofold infliction confounded by inbred faction and beleagured by a cruel and imperious external foe <\s>
<s> but these remembrances did not vent themselves in reproaches nor hinder us from being reconciled to our rulers when a change or rather a revolution in circumstances had imposed new duties and in defiance of local and personal clamour it may be safely said that the nation united heart and hand with the government in its resolve to meet the worst rather than stoop its head to receive that which it was felt would not be the garland but the yoke of peace <\s>
<s> yet it was an afflicting alternative and it is not to be denied that the effort if it had the determination wanted the cheerfulness of duty <\s>
<s> our condition savoured too much of a grinding constraint too much of the vassalage of necessity it had too much of fear and therefore of selfishness not to be contemplated in the main with rueful emotion <\s>
<s> we desponded though we did not despair <\s>
<s> in fact a deliberate and preparatory fortitude a sedate and stern melancholy which had no sunshine and was exhilarated only by the lightnings of indignation this was the highest and best state of moral feeling to which the most noble minded among us could attain <\s>
<s> but from the moment of the rising of the people of the pyrenëan peninsula there was a mighty change we were instantaneously animated and from that moment the contest assumed the dignity which it is not in the power of any thing but hope to bestow and if i may dare to transfer language prompted by a revelation of the state of being that admits not of decay or change to the concerns and interests of our transitory planet from that moment this corruptible put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality <\s>
<s> this sudden elevation was on no account more welcome was by nothing more endeared than by the returning sense which accompanied it of inward liberty and choice which gratified our moral yearnings inasmuch as it would give henceforward to our actions as a people an origination and direction unquestionably moral as it was free as it was manifestly in sympathy with the species as it admitted therefore of fluctuations of generous feeling of approbation and of complacency <\s>
<s> we were intellectualized also in proportion we looked backward upon the records of the human race with pride and instead of being afraid we delighted to look forward into futurity <\s>
<s> it was imagined that this new born spirit of resistance rising from the most sacred feelings of the human heart would diffuse itself through many countries and not merely for the distant future but for the present hopes were entertained as bold as they were disinterested and generous <\s>
<s> never indeed was the fellowship of our sentient nature more intimately felt never was the irresistible power of justice more gloriously displayed than when the british and spanish nations with an impulse like that of two ancient heroes throwing down their weapons and reconciled in the field cast off at once their aversions and enmities and mutually embraced each other to solemnize this conversion of love not by the festivities of peace but by combating side by side through danger and under affliction in the devotedness of perfect brotherhood <\s>
<s> this was a conjunction which excited hope as fervent as it was rational <\s>
<s> on the one side was a nation which brought with it sanction and authority inasmuch as it had tried and approved the blessings for which the other had risen to contend the one was a people which by the help of the surrounding ocean and its own virtues had preserved to itself through ages its liberty pure and inviolated by a foreign invader the other a high minded nation which a tyrant presuming on its decrepitude had through the real decrepitude of its government perfidiously enslaved <\s>
<s> what could be more delightful than to think of an intercourse beginning in this manner <\s>
<s> on the part of the spaniards their love towards us was enthusiasm and adoration the faults of our national character were hidden from them by a veil of splendour they saw nothing around us but glory and light and on our side we estimated their character with partial and indulgent fondness thinking on their past greatness not as the undermined foundation of a magnificent building but as the root of a majestic tree recovered from a long disease and beginning again to flourish with promise of wider branches and a deeper shade than it had boasted in the fulness of its strength <\s>
<s> if in the sensations with which the spaniards prostrated themselves before the religion of their country we did not keep pace with them if even their loyalty was such as from our mixed constitution of government and from other causes we could not thoroughly sympathize with and if lastly their devotion to the person of their sovereign appeared to us to have too much of the alloy of delusion in all these things we judged them gently and taught by the reverses of the french revolution we looked upon these dispositions as more human more social and therefore as wiser and of better omen than if they had stood forth the zealots of abstract principles drawn out of the laboratory of unfeeling philosophists <\s>
<s> finally in this reverence for the past and present we found an earnest that they were prepared to contend to the death for as much liberty as their habits and their knowledge enabled them to receive <\s>
<s> to assist them and their neighbours the portugueze in the attainment of this end we sent to them in love and in friendship a powerful army to aid to invigorate and to chastise they landed and the first proof they afforded of their being worthy to be sent on such a service the first pledge of amity given by them was the victory of vimiera the second pledge and this was from the hand of their generals was the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the reader will by this time have perceived what thoughts were uppermost in my mind when i began with asserting that this convention is among the most important events of our times an assertion which was made deliberately and after due allowance for that infirmity which inclines us to magnify things present and passing at the expence of those which are past <\s>
<s> it is my aim to prove wherein the real importance of this event lies and as a necessary preparative for forming a right judgment upon it i have already given a representation of the sentiments with which the people of great britain and those of spain looked upon each other <\s>
<s> i have indeed spoken rather of the spaniards than of the portugueze but what has been said will be understood as applying in the main to the whole peninsula <\s>
<s> the wrongs of the two nations have been equal and their cause is the same they must stand or fall together <\s>
<s> what their wrongs have been in what degree they considered themselves united and what their hopes and resolutions were we have learned from public papers issued by themselves and by their enemies <\s>
<s> these were read by the people of this country at the time when they were severally published with due impression pity that those impressions could not have been as faithfully retained as they were at first received deeply <\s>
<s> doubtless there is not a man in these islands who is not convinced that the cause of spain is the most righteous cause in which since the opposition of the greek republics to the persian invader at thermopylae and marathon sword ever was drawn <\s>
<s> but this is not enough <\s>
<s> we are actors in the struggle and in order that we may have steady principles to controul and direct us without which we may do much harm and can do no good we ought to make it a duty to revive in the memory those words and facts which first carried the conviction to our hearts that as far as it is possible we may see as we then saw and feel as we then felt <\s>
<s> let me therefore entreat the reader seriously to peruse once more such parts of those declarations as i shall extract from them <\s>
<s> i feel indeed with sorrow that events are hurrying us forward as down the rapid of an american river and that there is too much danger before to permit the mind easily to turn back upon the course which is past <\s>
<s> it is indeed difficult but i need not say that to yield to the difficulty would be degrading to rational beings <\s>
<s> besides if from the retrospect we can either gain strength by which we can overcome or learn prudence by which we may avoid such submission is not only degrading but pernicious <\s>
<s> i address these words to those who have feeling but whose judgment is overpowered by their feelings such as have not and who are mere slaves of curiosity calling perpetually for something new and being able to create nothing new for themselves out of old materials may be left to wander about under the yoke of their own unprofitable appetite yet not so <\s>
<s> even these i would include in my request and conjure them as they are men not to be impatient while i place before their eyes a composition made out of fragments of those declarations from various parts of the peninsula which disposed as it were in a tesselated pavement shall set forth a story which may be easily understood which will move and teach and be consolatory to him who looks upon it <\s>
<s> i say consolatory and let not the reader shrink from the word <\s>
<s> i am well aware of the burthen which is to be supported of the discountenance from recent calamity under which every thing which speaks of hope for the spanish people and through them for mankind will be received <\s>
<s> but this far from deterring ought to be an encouragement it makes the duty more imperious <\s>
<s> nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature <\s>
<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>

<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>
<s> yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success <\s>
<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>

<s> in a word it would not be too much to say that the tidings of this event did not spread with the commotion of a storm which sweeps visibly over our heads but like an earthquake which rocks the ground under our feet <\s>
<s> how was it possible that it could be otherwise <\s>
<s> for that army had been sent upon a service which appealed so strongly to all that was human in the heart of this nation that there was scarcely a gallant father of a family who had not his moments of regret that he was not a soldier by profession which might have made it his duty to accompany it every high minded youth grieved that his first impulses which would have sent him upon the same errand were not to be yielded to and that after thought did not sanction and confirm the instantaneous dictates or the reiterated persuasions of an heroic spirit <\s>
<s> the army took its departure with prayers and blessings which were as widely spread as they were fervent and intense <\s>
<s> for it was not doubted that on this occasion every person of which it was composed from the general to the private soldier would carry both into his conflicts with the enemy in the field and into his relations of peaceful intercourse with the inhabitants not only the virtues which might be expected from him as a soldier but the antipathies and sympathies the loves and hatreds of a citizen of a human being acting in a manner hitherto unprecedented under the obligation of his human and social nature <\s>
<s> if the conduct of the rapacious and merciless adversary rendered it neither easy nor wise made it i might say impossible to give way to that unqualified admiration of courage and skill made it impossible in relation to him to be exalted by those triumphs of the courteous affections and to be purified by those refinements of civility which do more than any thing reconcile a man of thoughtful mind and humane dispositions to the horrors of ordinary war it was felt that for such loss the benign and accomplished soldier would upon this mission be abundantly recompensed by the enthusiasm of fraternal love with which his ally the oppressed people whom he was going to aid in rescuing themselves would receive him and that this and the virtues which he would witness in them would furnish his heart with never failing and far nobler objects of complacency and admiration <\s>
<s> the discipline of the army was well known and as a machine or a vital organized body the nation was assured that it could not but be formidable but thus to the standing excellence of mechanic or organic power seemed to be superadded at this time and for this service the force of inspiration could any thing therefore be looked for but a glorious result <\s>
<s> the army proved its prowess in the field and what has been the result is attested and long will be attested by the downcast looks the silence the passionate exclamations the sighs and shame of every man who is worthy to breathe the air or to look upon the green fields of liberty in this blessed and highly favoured island which we inhabit <\s>
<s> if i were speaking of things however weighty that were long past and dwindled in the memory i should scarcely venture to use this language but the feelings are of yesterday they are of to day the flower a melancholy flower it is <\s>
<s> is still in blow nor will i trust its leaves be shed through months that are to come for i repeat that the heart of the nation is in this struggle <\s>
<s> this just and necessary war as we have been accustomed to hear it styled from the beginning of the contest in the year 1793 had some time before the treaty of amiens viz <\s>
<s> after the subjugation of switzerland and not till then begun to be regarded by the body of the people as indeed both just and necessary and this justice and necessity were by none more clearly perceived or more feelingly bewailed than by those who had most eagerly opposed the war in its commencement and who continued most bitterly to regret that this nation had ever borne a part in it <\s>
<s> their conduct was herein consistent they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles for though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition <\s>
<s> this spirit the class of persons of whom i have been speaking and i would now be understood as associating them with an immense majority of the people of great britain whose affections notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them were in the former part of the contest for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies this spirit when it became undeniably embodied in the french government they wished in spite of all dangers should be opposed by war because peace was not to be procured without submission which could not but be followed by a communion of which the word of greeting would be on the one part insult and on the other degradation <\s>
<s> the people now wished for war as their rulers had done before because open war between nations is a defined and effectual partition and the sword in the hands of the good and the virtuous is the most intelligible symbol of abhorrence <\s>
<s> it was in order to be preserved from spirit breaking submissions from the guilt of seeming to approve that which they had not the power to prevent and out of a consciousness of the danger that such guilt would otherwise actually steal upon them and that thus by evil communications and participations would be weakened and finally destroyed those moral sensibilities and energies by virtue of which alone their liberties and even their lives could be preserved that the people of great britain determined to encounter all perils which could follow in the train of open resistance there were some and those deservedly of high character in the country who exerted their utmost influence to counteract this resolution nor did they give to it so gentle a name as want of prudence but they boldly termed it blindness and obstinacy <\s>
<s> let them be judged with charity <\s>
<s> but there are promptings of wisdom from the penetralia of human nature which a people can hear though the wisest of their practical statesmen be deaf towards them <\s>
<s> this authentic voice the people of england had heard and obeyed and in opposition to french tyranny growing daily more insatiate and implacable they ranged themselves zealously under their government though they neither forgot nor forgave its transgressions in having first involved them in a war with a people then struggling for its own liberties under a twofold infliction confounded by inbred faction and beleagured by a cruel and imperious external foe <\s>
<s> but these remembrances did not vent themselves in reproaches nor hinder us from being reconciled to our rulers when a change or rather a revolution in circumstances had imposed new duties and in defiance of local and personal clamour it may be safely said that the nation united heart and hand with the government in its resolve to meet the worst rather than stoop its head to receive that which it was felt would not be the garland but the yoke of peace <\s>
<s> yet it was an afflicting alternative and it is not to be denied that the effort if it had the determination wanted the cheerfulness of duty <\s>
<s> our condition savoured too much of a grinding constraint too much of the vassalage of necessity it had too much of fear and therefore of selfishness not to be contemplated in the main with rueful emotion <\s>
<s> we desponded though we did not despair <\s>
<s> in fact a deliberate and preparatory fortitude a sedate and stern melancholy which had no sunshine and was exhilarated only by the lightnings of indignation this was the highest and best state of moral feeling to which the most noble minded among us could attain <\s>
<s> but from the moment of the rising of the people of the pyrenëan peninsula there was a mighty change we were instantaneously animated and from that moment the contest assumed the dignity which it is not in the power of any thing but hope to bestow and if i may dare to transfer language prompted by a revelation of the state of being that admits not of decay or change to the concerns and interests of our transitory planet from that moment this corruptible put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality <\s>
<s> this sudden elevation was on no account more welcome was by nothing more endeared than by the returning sense which accompanied it of inward liberty and choice which gratified our moral yearnings inasmuch as it would give henceforward to our actions as a people an origination and direction unquestionably moral as it was free as it was manifestly in sympathy with the species as it admitted therefore of fluctuations of generous feeling of approbation and of complacency <\s>
<s> we were intellectualized also in proportion we looked backward upon the records of the human race with pride and instead of being afraid we delighted to look forward into futurity <\s>
<s> it was imagined that this new born spirit of resistance rising from the most sacred feelings of the human heart would diffuse itself through many countries and not merely for the distant future but for the present hopes were entertained as bold as they were disinterested and generous <\s>
<s> never indeed was the fellowship of our sentient nature more intimately felt never was the irresistible power of justice more gloriously displayed than when the british and spanish nations with an impulse like that of two ancient heroes throwing down their weapons and reconciled in the field cast off at once their aversions and enmities and mutually embraced each other to solemnize this conversion of love not by the festivities of peace but by combating side by side through danger and under affliction in the devotedness of perfect brotherhood <\s>
<s> this was a conjunction which excited hope as fervent as it was rational <\s>
<s> on the one side was a nation which brought with it sanction and authority inasmuch as it had tried and approved the blessings for which the other had risen to contend the one was a people which by the help of the surrounding ocean and its own virtues had preserved to itself through ages its liberty pure and inviolated by a foreign invader the other a high minded nation which a tyrant presuming on its decrepitude had through the real decrepitude of its government perfidiously enslaved <\s>
<s> what could be more delightful than to think of an intercourse beginning in this manner <\s>
<s> on the part of the spaniards their love towards us was enthusiasm and adoration the faults of our national character were hidden from them by a veil of splendour they saw nothing around us but glory and light and on our side we estimated their character with partial and indulgent fondness thinking on their past greatness not as the undermined foundation of a magnificent building but as the root of a majestic tree recovered from a long disease and beginning again to flourish with promise of wider branches and a deeper shade than it had boasted in the fulness of its strength <\s>
<s> if in the sensations with which the spaniards prostrated themselves before the religion of their country we did not keep pace with them if even their loyalty was such as from our mixed constitution of government and from other causes we could not thoroughly sympathize with and if lastly their devotion to the person of their sovereign appeared to us to have too much of the alloy of delusion in all these things we judged them gently and taught by the reverses of the french revolution we looked upon these dispositions as more human more social and therefore as wiser and of better omen than if they had stood forth the zealots of abstract principles drawn out of the laboratory of unfeeling philosophists <\s>
<s> finally in this reverence for the past and present we found an earnest that they were prepared to contend to the death for as much liberty as their habits and their knowledge enabled them to receive <\s>
<s> to assist them and their neighbours the portugueze in the attainment of this end we sent to them in love and in friendship a powerful army to aid to invigorate and to chastise they landed and the first proof they afforded of their being worthy to be sent on such a service the first pledge of amity given by them was the victory of vimiera the second pledge and this was from the hand of their generals was the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> the reader will by this time have perceived what thoughts were uppermost in my mind when i began with asserting that this convention is among the most important events of our times an assertion which was made deliberately and after due allowance for that infirmity which inclines us to magnify things present and passing at the expence of those which are past <\s>
<s> it is my aim to prove wherein the real importance of this event lies and as a necessary preparative for forming a right judgment upon it i have already given a representation of the sentiments with which the people of great britain and those of spain looked upon each other <\s>
<s> i have indeed spoken rather of the spaniards than of the portugueze but what has been said will be understood as applying in the main to the whole peninsula <\s>
<s> the wrongs of the two nations have been equal and their cause is the same they must stand or fall together <\s>
<s> what their wrongs have been in what degree they considered themselves united and what their hopes and resolutions were we have learned from public papers issued by themselves and by their enemies <\s>
<s> these were read by the people of this country at the time when they were severally published with due impression pity that those impressions could not have been as faithfully retained as they were at first received deeply <\s>
<s> doubtless there is not a man in these islands who is not convinced that the cause of spain is the most righteous cause in which since the opposition of the greek republics to the persian invader at thermopylae and marathon sword ever was drawn <\s>
<s> but this is not enough <\s>
<s> we are actors in the struggle and in order that we may have steady principles to controul and direct us without which we may do much harm and can do no good we ought to make it a duty to revive in the memory those words and facts which first carried the conviction to our hearts that as far as it is possible we may see as we then saw and feel as we then felt <\s>
<s> let me therefore entreat the reader seriously to peruse once more such parts of those declarations as i shall extract from them <\s>
<s> i feel indeed with sorrow that events are hurrying us forward as down the rapid of an american river and that there is too much danger before to permit the mind easily to turn back upon the course which is past <\s>
<s> it is indeed difficult but i need not say that to yield to the difficulty would be degrading to rational beings <\s>
<s> besides if from the retrospect we can either gain strength by which we can overcome or learn prudence by which we may avoid such submission is not only degrading but pernicious <\s>
<s> i address these words to those who have feeling but whose judgment is overpowered by their feelings such as have not and who are mere slaves of curiosity calling perpetually for something new and being able to create nothing new for themselves out of old materials may be left to wander about under the yoke of their own unprofitable appetite yet not so <\s>
<s> even these i would include in my request and conjure them as they are men not to be impatient while i place before their eyes a composition made out of fragments of those declarations from various parts of the peninsula which disposed as it were in a tesselated pavement shall set forth a story which may be easily understood which will move and teach and be consolatory to him who looks upon it <\s>
<s> i say consolatory and let not the reader shrink from the word <\s>
<s> i am well aware of the burthen which is to be supported of the discountenance from recent calamity under which every thing which speaks of hope for the spanish people and through them for mankind will be received <\s>
<s> but this far from deterring ought to be an encouragement it makes the duty more imperious <\s>
<s> nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature <\s>
<s> i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject <\s>
<s> it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war <\s>
<s> this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation <\s>
<s> and what is the amount of the evil it is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugation much less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature <\s>
<s> for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits <\s>
<s> the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power <\s>
<s> hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost <\s>
<s> supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to re adopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error <\s>
<s> in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us <\s>
<s> the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it <\s>
<s> yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success <\s>
<s> to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred <\s>
<s> secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior mind a doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repel then are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth <\s>
