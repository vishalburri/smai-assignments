<s> your poem i have read with no inconsiderable pleasure it is full of natural sentiments and pleasing pictures among the minor pieces the last pleased me much the best and especially the latter part of it <\s>
<s> this little volume with what i saw of yourself during a short interview interest me in your welfare and the more so as i always feel some apprehension for the destiny of those who in youth addict themselves to the composition of verse <\s>
<s> it is a very seducing employment and though begun in disinterested love of the muses is too apt to connect itself with self love and the disquieting passions which follow in the train of that our natural infirmity <\s>
<s> fix your eye upon acquiring independence by honourable business and let the muses come after rather than go before <\s>
<s> such lines as the latter of this couplet where lovely woman chaste as heaven above <\s>
<s> shines in the golden virtues of her love and many other passages in your poem give proof of no common place sensibility <\s>
<s> i am therefore the more earnest that you should guard yourself against this temptation <\s>

<s> my dear sir you will have no pain to suffer from my sincerity <\s>
<s> with a safe conscience i can assure you that in my judgment your verses are animated with true poetic spirit as they are evidently the product of strong feeling <\s>
<s> the sixth and seventh stanzas affected me much even to the dimming of my eye and faltering of my voice while i was reading them aloud <\s>
<s> having said this i have said enough now for the per contra <\s>
<s> you will not i am sure be hurt when i tell you that the workmanship what else could be expected from so young a writer is not what it ought to be even in those two affecting stanzas it is not perfect some touch of human sympathy find way and whisper that though truth's and science ray with such serene effulgence o'er thee shone <\s>
<s> sympathy might whisper but a touch of sympathy could not <\s>
<s> truth's and science ray for the ray of truth and science is not only extremely harsh but a ray shone is if not absolutely a pleonasm a great awkwardness a ray fell or shot may be said and a sun or a moon or a candle shone but not a ray <\s>
<s> i much regret that i did not receive these verses while you were here that i might have given you viv?? voce a comment upon them which would be tedious by letter and after all very imperfect <\s>
<s> if i have the pleasure of seeing you again i will beg permission to dissect these verses or any other you may be inclined to show me but i am certain that without conference with me or any benefit drawn from my practice in metrical composition your own high powers of mind will lead you to the main conclusions <\s>
<s> you will be brought to acknowledge that the logical faculty has infinitely more to do with poetry than the young and the inexperienced whether writer or critic ever dreams of <\s>
<s> indeed as the materials upon which that faculty is exorcised in poetry are so subtle so plastic so complex the application of it requires an adroitness which can proceed from nothing but practice a discernment which emotion is so far from bestowing that at first it is ever in the way of it <\s>
<s> here i must stop only let me advert to two lines but shall despondence therefore blench my brow or pining sorrow sickly ardor o'er <\s>
<s> these are two of the worst lines in mere expression <\s>
<s> blench is perhaps miswritten for blanch if not i don't understand the word <\s>
<s> blench signifies to flinch <\s>
<s> if blanch be the word the next ought to be hair <\s>
<s> you cannot here use brow for the hair upon it because a white brow or forehead is a beautiful characteristic of youth <\s>
<s> sickly ardor o'er was at first reading to me unintelligible <\s>
<s> i took sickly to be an adjective joined with ardor whereas you mean it as a portion of a verb from shakspeare sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought <\s>
<s> but the separation of the parts or decomposition of the word as here done is not to be endured <\s>
<s> let me now come to your sister's verses for which i thank you <\s>
<s> they are surprisingly vigorous for a female pen but occasionally too rugged and especially for such a subject they have also the same faults in expression as your own but not i think in quite an equal degree <\s>
<s> much is to be hoped from feelings so strong and from a mind thus disposed <\s>
<s> i should have entered into particulars with these also had i seen you after they came into my hands <\s>
<s> your sister is no doubt aware that in her poem she has trodden the same ground as gray in his ode upon a distant prospect of eton college <\s>
<s> what he has been contented to treat in the abstract she has represented in particular and with admirable spirit <\s>
<s> but again my dear sir let me exhort you and do you exhort your sister to deal little with modern writers but fix your attention almost exclusively upon those who have stood the test of time <\s>
<s> you have not leisure to allow of your being tempted to turn aside from the right course by deceitful lights <\s>
<s> my household desire to be remembered to you in no formal way <\s>

<s> you are at perfect liberty to declare that you have rejected bell's copy in consequence of my opinion of it and i feel much satisfaction in being the instrument of rescuing the memory of collins from this disgrace <\s>

<s> 98 i e convinced by what wordsworth had remarked to me that those portions of collins's ode on the superstitions of the highlanders which first appeared in bell's edition of that ode were forgeries <\s>
<s> a d dyer is another of our minor poets minor as to quantity of whom one would wish to know more <\s>
<s> particulars about him might still be collected i should think in south wales his native country and where in early life he practised as a painter <\s>
<s> i have often heard sir george beaumont express a curiosity about his pictures and a wish to see any specimen of his pencil that might survive <\s>
<s> if you are a rambler perhaps you may at some time or other be led into carmarthenshire and might bear in mind what i have just said of this excellent author <\s>
<s> i had once a hope to have learned some unknown particulars of thomson about jedburgh but i was disappointed <\s>
<s> had i succeeded i meant to publish a short life of him prefixed to a volume containing the seasons the castle of indolence his minor pieces in rhyme and a few extracts from his plays and his liberty and i feel still inclined to do something of the kind <\s>
<s> these three writers thomson collins and dyer had more poetic imagination than any of their contemporaries unless we reckon chatterton as of that age <\s>

<s> my dear sir i have been very long in your debt <\s>
<s> an inflammation in my eyes cut me off from writing and reading so that i deem it still prudent to employ an amanuensis but i had a more decisive reason for putting off payment nothing less than the hope that i might discharge my debt in person it seems better however to consult you beforehand <\s>
<s> i wish to make a tour in ireland and perhaps along with my daughter but i am ignorant of so many points as where to begin whether it be safe at this rioting period what is best worth seeing what mode of travelling will furnish the greatest advantages at the least expense <\s>
<s> dublin of course the wicklow mountains killarney lakes and i think the ruins not far from limerick would be among my objects and return by the north but i can form no conjecture as to the time requisite for this and whether it would be best to take the steamboat from liverpool to cork beginning there or to go from whitehaven to dublin <\s>
<s> to start from whitehaven by steam to dublin would suit me as being nearer this place and a shorter voyage besides my son is settled near whitehaven and i could conveniently embark from his abode <\s>
<s> i have read with great pleasure the sketches in ireland which mr <\s>
<s> otway was kind enough to present to me but many interesting things he speaks of in the west will be quite out of my reach <\s>
<s> in short i am as unprepared with tourists information as any man can be and sensible as i am of the very great value of your time i cannot refrain from begging you to take pity upon my ignorance and to give me some information keeping in mind the possibility of my having a female companion <\s>
<s> excuse this wretched scrawl it is like all that proceeds from my miserable pen <\s>
<s> ever faithfully yours wm <\s>
<s> dear wrangham you are very good in sending one letter after another to inquire after a person so undeserving of attentions of this kind as myself <\s>
<s> johnson i think observes or rather is made to observe by some of his biographers that no man delights to give what he is accustomed to sell <\s>
<s> for example you mr <\s>
<s> thrale would rather part with anything in this way than your porter <\s>
<s> now though i have never been much of a salesman in matters of literature the whole of my returns i do not say net profits but returns from the writing trade not amounting to seven score pounds yet somehow or other i manufacture a letter and part with it as reluctantly as if it were really a thing of price <\s>
<s> but to drop the comparison i have so much to do with writing in the way of labour and profession that it is difficult to me to conceive how anybody can take up a pen but from constraint <\s>
<s> my writing desk is to me a place of punishment and as my penmanship sufficiently testifies <\s>
<s> i always bend over it with some degree of impatience <\s>
<s> all this is said that you may know the real cause of my silence and not ascribe it in any degree to slight or forgetfulness on my part or an insensibility to your worth and the value of your friendship .... <\s>
<s> as to my occupations they look little at the present age but i live in hope of leaving something behind me that by some minds will be valued <\s>
<s> i see no new books except by the merest accident <\s>
<s> of course your poem which i should have been pleased to read has not found its way to me <\s>
<s> you inquire about old books you might almost as well have asked for my teeth as for any of mine <\s>
<s> the only modern books that i read are those of travels or such as relate to matters of fact and the only modern books that i care for but as to old ones i am like yourself scarcely anything comes amiss to me <\s>
<s> the little time i have to spare the very little i may say all goes that way <\s>
<s> if however in the line of your profession you want any bulky old commentaries on the scriptures such as not twelve strong men of these degenerate days will venture i do not say to read but to lift i can perhaps as a special favour accommodate you <\s>
<s> i and mine will be happy to see you and yours here or anywhere but i am sorry the time you talk of is so distant a year and a half is a long time looking forward though looking back ten times as much is as brief as a dream <\s>

<s> if i have the pleasure of seeing you again i will beg permission to dissect these verses or any other you may be inclined to show me but i am certain that without conference with me or any benefit drawn from my practice in metrical composition your own high powers of mind will lead you to the main conclusions <\s>
<s> you will be brought to acknowledge that the logical faculty has infinitely more to do with poetry than the young and the inexperienced whether writer or critic ever dreams of <\s>
<s> indeed as the materials upon which that faculty is exorcised in poetry are so subtle so plastic so complex the application of it requires an adroitness which can proceed from nothing but practice a discernment which emotion is so far from bestowing that at first it is ever in the way of it <\s>
<s> here i must stop only let me advert to two lines but shall despondence therefore blench my brow or pining sorrow sickly ardor o'er <\s>
<s> these are two of the worst lines in mere expression <\s>
<s> blench is perhaps miswritten for blanch if not i don't understand the word <\s>
<s> blench signifies to flinch <\s>
<s> if blanch be the word the next ought to be hair <\s>
<s> you cannot here use brow for the hair upon it because a white brow or forehead is a beautiful characteristic of youth <\s>
<s> sickly ardor o'er was at first reading to me unintelligible <\s>
<s> i took sickly to be an adjective joined with ardor whereas you mean it as a portion of a verb from shakspeare sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought <\s>
<s> but the separation of the parts or decomposition of the word as here done is not to be endured <\s>
<s> let me now come to your sister's verses for which i thank you <\s>
<s> they are surprisingly vigorous for a female pen but occasionally too rugged and especially for such a subject they have also the same faults in expression as your own but not i think in quite an equal degree <\s>
<s> much is to be hoped from feelings so strong and from a mind thus disposed <\s>
<s> i should have entered into particulars with these also had i seen you after they came into my hands <\s>
<s> your sister is no doubt aware that in her poem she has trodden the same ground as gray in his ode upon a distant prospect of eton college <\s>
<s> what he has been contented to treat in the abstract she has represented in particular and with admirable spirit <\s>
<s> but again my dear sir let me exhort you and do you exhort your sister to deal little with modern writers but fix your attention almost exclusively upon those who have stood the test of time <\s>
<s> you have not leisure to allow of your being tempted to turn aside from the right course by deceitful lights <\s>
<s> my household desire to be remembered to you in no formal way <\s>
<s> seldom have i parted never i was going to say with one whom after so short an acquaintance i lost sight of with more regret <\s>
<s> i trust we shall meet again if not sentence cut off with the autograph <\s>
<s> pray do not forget to remember me to mr <\s>
<s> i was much pleased with him and with your fellow traveller mr <\s>
<s> nimmo as i should have been no doubt with the young irishman had not our conversation taken so serious a turn <\s>
<s> the passage in tacitus which milton's line so strongly resembles is not in the agricola nor can i find it but it exists somewhere <\s>
<s> of collins dyer thomson c letter to rev <\s>
<s> rydal mount kendal jan <\s>
<s> dear sir i regret to hear of the indisposition from which you have been suffering <\s>
<s> that you are convinced 98 gives me great pleasure as i hope that every other editor of collins will follow your example <\s>
<s> you are at perfect liberty to declare that you have rejected bell's copy in consequence of my opinion of it and i feel much satisfaction in being the instrument of rescuing the memory of collins from this disgrace <\s>
<s> i have always felt some concern that mr <\s>
<s> home who lived several years after bell's publication did not testify more regard for his deceased friend's memory by protesting against this imposition <\s>
<s> mackenzie is still living and i shall shortly have his opinion upon the question and if it be at all interesting i shall take the liberty of sending it to you <\s>
<s> 212 14 with important additions from the original <\s>
<s> 98 i e convinced by what wordsworth had remarked to me that those portions of collins's ode on the superstitions of the highlanders which first appeared in bell's edition of that ode were forgeries <\s>
<s> a d dyer is another of our minor poets minor as to quantity of whom one would wish to know more <\s>
<s> particulars about him might still be collected i should think in south wales his native country and where in early life he practised as a painter <\s>
<s> i have often heard sir george beaumont express a curiosity about his pictures and a wish to see any specimen of his pencil that might survive <\s>
<s> if you are a rambler perhaps you may at some time or other be led into carmarthenshire and might bear in mind what i have just said of this excellent author <\s>
<s> i had once a hope to have learned some unknown particulars of thomson about jedburgh but i was disappointed <\s>
<s> had i succeeded i meant to publish a short life of him prefixed to a volume containing the seasons the castle of indolence his minor pieces in rhyme and a few extracts from his plays and his liberty and i feel still inclined to do something of the kind <\s>
<s> these three writers thomson collins and dyer had more poetic imagination than any of their contemporaries unless we reckon chatterton as of that age <\s>
<s> i do not name pope for he stands alone as a man most highly gifted but unluckily he took the plain when the heights were within his reach <\s>
<s> excuse this long letter and believe me sincerely yours wm <\s>
<s> wordsworth 99 99 memoirs ii <\s>
<s> letter to professor hamilton observatory dublin <\s>
<s> rydal mount july 24 <\s>
<s> my dear sir i have been very long in your debt <\s>
<s> an inflammation in my eyes cut me off from writing and reading so that i deem it still prudent to employ an amanuensis but i had a more decisive reason for putting off payment nothing less than the hope that i might discharge my debt in person it seems better however to consult you beforehand <\s>
<s> i wish to make a tour in ireland and perhaps along with my daughter but i am ignorant of so many points as where to begin whether it be safe at this rioting period what is best worth seeing what mode of travelling will furnish the greatest advantages at the least expense <\s>
<s> dublin of course the wicklow mountains killarney lakes and i think the ruins not far from limerick would be among my objects and return by the north but i can form no conjecture as to the time requisite for this and whether it would be best to take the steamboat from liverpool to cork beginning there or to go from whitehaven to dublin <\s>
<s> to start from whitehaven by steam to dublin would suit me as being nearer this place and a shorter voyage besides my son is settled near whitehaven and i could conveniently embark from his abode <\s>
<s> i have read with great pleasure the sketches in ireland which mr <\s>
<s> otway was kind enough to present to me but many interesting things he speaks of in the west will be quite out of my reach <\s>
<s> in short i am as unprepared with tourists information as any man can be and sensible as i am of the very great value of your time i cannot refrain from begging you to take pity upon my ignorance and to give me some information keeping in mind the possibility of my having a female companion <\s>
