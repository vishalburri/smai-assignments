<s> there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects <\s>

<s> i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse <\s>
<s> the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it <\s>
<s> thanks for dear lady b s transcript from your friend's letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it <\s>

<s> the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent <\s>

<s> i long much to see it <\s>
<s> i should approve of any engraver approved by you <\s>
<s> but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expence of the engraving and that the poem in the estimation of the public would be a weight upon the print <\s>
<s> i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse <\s>
<s> the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it <\s>
<s> thanks for dear lady b s transcript from your friend's letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it <\s>
<s> instances of what i mean says your friend are to be found in a poem on a daisy by the by it is on the daisy a mighty difference and on daffodils reflected in the water <\s>
<s> is this accurately transcribed by lady beaumont <\s>
<s> if it be what shall we think of criticism or judgment founded upon and exemplified by a poem which must have been so inattentively perused <\s>

<s> beneath the trees ten thousand dancing in the breeze <\s>

<s> and let me ask your friend how it is possible for flowers to be reflected in water where there are waves <\s>
<s> they may indeed in still water but the very object of my poem is the trouble or agitation both of the flowers and the water <\s>
<s> i must needs respect the understanding of every one honoured by your friendship but sincerity compels me to say that my poems must be more nearly looked at before they can give rise to any remarks of much value even from the strongest minds <\s>
<s> with respect to this individual poem lady b <\s>
<s> will recollect how mrs <\s>
<s> fermor expressed herself upon it <\s>
<s> a letter also was sent to me addressed to a friend of mine and by him communicated to me in which this identical poem was singled out for fervent approbation <\s>
<s> what then shall we say <\s>
<s> why let the poet first consult his own heart as i have done and leave the rest to posterity to i hope an improving posterity <\s>
<s> the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent <\s>
<s> in short in your friend's letter i am condemned for the very thing for which i ought to have been praised viz that i have not written down to the level of superficial observers and unthinking minds <\s>
<s> every great poet is a teacher i wish either to be considered as a teacher or as nothing <\s>
<s> to turn to a more pleasing subject <\s>
<s> have you painted anything else beside this picture from peter bell <\s>
<s> your two oil paintings and indeed everything i have of yours have been much admired by the artists who have seen them <\s>
<s> and for our own parts we like them better every day this in particular is the case with the small picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton which indeed pleased me much at the first sight but less impressed the rest of our household who now see as many beauties in it as i do myself <\s>
<s> havill the water colour painter was much pleased with these things he is painting at ambleside and has done a view of rydal water looking down upon it from rydal park of which i should like to know your opinion it will be exhibited in the spring in the water colour exhibition <\s>
<s> i have purchased a black lead pencil sketch of mr <\s>
<s> green of ambleside which i think has great merit the materials being uncommonly picturesque and well put together i should dearly like to have the same subject it is the cottage at glencoign by ulleswater treated by you <\s>
<s> in the poem i have just written you will find one situation which if the work should ever become familiarly known would furnish as fine a subject for a picture as any thing i remember in poetry ancient or modern <\s>
<s> i need not mention what it is as when you read the poem you cannot miss it <\s>
<s> we have at last had by the same post two letters from coleridge long and melancholy and also from keswick an account so depressing as to the state of his health that i should have set off immediately to london to see him if i had not myself been confined by indisposition <\s>

<s> i am well aware how far it would seem to many i over rate my own exertions when i speak in this way in direct connection with the volume i have just made public <\s>
<s> i am not however afraid of such censure insignificant as probably the majority of those poems would appear to very respectable persons <\s>
<s> i do not mean london wits and witlings for these have too many foul passions about them to be respectable even if they had more intellect than the benign laws of providence will allow to such a heartless existence as theirs is but grave kindly natured worthy persons who would be pleased if they could <\s>
<s> i hope that these volumes are not without some recommendations even for readers of this class but their imagination has slept and the voice which is the voice of my poetry without imagination cannot be heard <\s>
<s> leaving these i was going to say a word to such readers as mr <\s>
<s> such how would he be offended if he knew i considered him only as a representative of a class and not an unique <\s>
<s> that so many trifling things should be admitted to obstruct the view of those that have merit <\s>
<s> now let this candid judge take by way of example the sonnets which probably with the exception of two or three other poems for which i will not contend appear to him the most trifling as they are the shortest <\s>
<s> i would say to him omitting things of higher consideration there is one thing which must strike you at once if you will only read these poems that those to liberty at least have a connection with or a bearing upon each other and therefore if individually they want weight perhaps as a body they may not be so deficient <\s>
<s> at least this ought to induce you to suspend your judgment and qualify it so far as to allow that the writer aims at least at comprehensiveness <\s>
<s> but dropping this i would boldly say at once that these sonnets while they each fix the attention upon some important sentiment separately considered do at the same time collectively make a poem on the subject of civil liberty and national independence which either for simplicity of style or grandeur of moral sentiment is alas <\s>
<s> likely to have few parallels in the poetry of the present day <\s>
<s> again turn to the moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects <\s>
<s> this is poetic and essentially poetic <\s>
<s> because it is creative <\s>
<s> but i am wasting words for it is nothing more than you know and if said to those for whom it is intended it would not be understood <\s>
<s> i see by your last letter that mrs <\s>
<s> fermor has entered into the spirit of these moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> your transcript from her letter gave me the greatest pleasure but i must say that even she has something yet to receive from me <\s>
<s> i say this with confidence from her thinking that i have fallen below myself in the sonnet beginning with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh <\s>
<s> as to the other which she objects to i will only observe that there is a misprint in the last line but two and though this wilderness for and through this wilderness that makes it unintelligible <\s>
<s> this latter sonnet for many reasons though i do not abandon it i will not now speak of but upon the other i could say something important in conversation and will attempt now to illustrate it by a comment which i feel will be inadequate to convey my meaning <\s>
<s> there is scarcely one of my poems which does not aim to direct the attention to some moral sentiment or to some general principle or law of thought or of our intellectual constitution <\s>
<s> for instance in the present case who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects of which it either cannot make one whole or from which it cannot single out one individual whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided among or distracted by a multitude <\s>
<s> after a certain time we must either select one image or object which must put out of view the rest wholly or must subordinate them to itself while it stands forth as a head how glowed the firmament with living sapphires <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i am quite delighted to hear of your picture for peter bell i was much pleased with the sketch and i have no doubt that the picture will surpass it as far as a picture ought to do <\s>
<s> i long much to see it <\s>
<s> i should approve of any engraver approved by you <\s>
<s> but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expence of the engraving and that the poem in the estimation of the public would be a weight upon the print <\s>
<s> i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse <\s>
<s> the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it <\s>
<s> thanks for dear lady b s transcript from your friend's letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it <\s>
<s> instances of what i mean says your friend are to be found in a poem on a daisy by the by it is on the daisy a mighty difference and on daffodils reflected in the water <\s>
<s> is this accurately transcribed by lady beaumont <\s>
<s> if it be what shall we think of criticism or judgment founded upon and exemplified by a poem which must have been so inattentively perused <\s>
<s> my language is precise and therefore it would be false modesty to charge myself with blame <\s>
<s> beneath the trees ten thousand dancing in the breeze <\s>
<s> the waves beside them danced but they outdid the sparkling waves in glee <\s>
<s> can expression be more distinct <\s>
<s> and let me ask your friend how it is possible for flowers to be reflected in water where there are waves <\s>
<s> they may indeed in still water but the very object of my poem is the trouble or agitation both of the flowers and the water <\s>
<s> i must needs respect the understanding of every one honoured by your friendship but sincerity compels me to say that my poems must be more nearly looked at before they can give rise to any remarks of much value even from the strongest minds <\s>
<s> with respect to this individual poem lady b <\s>
<s> will recollect how mrs <\s>
<s> fermor expressed herself upon it <\s>
<s> a letter also was sent to me addressed to a friend of mine and by him communicated to me in which this identical poem was singled out for fervent approbation <\s>
<s> what then shall we say <\s>
<s> why let the poet first consult his own heart as i have done and leave the rest to posterity to i hope an improving posterity <\s>
<s> the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent <\s>
<s> in short in your friend's letter i am condemned for the very thing for which i ought to have been praised viz that i have not written down to the level of superficial observers and unthinking minds <\s>
<s> every great poet is a teacher i wish either to be considered as a teacher or as nothing <\s>
<s> to turn to a more pleasing subject <\s>
<s> have you painted anything else beside this picture from peter bell <\s>
<s> your two oil paintings and indeed everything i have of yours have been much admired by the artists who have seen them <\s>
<s> and for our own parts we like them better every day this in particular is the case with the small picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton which indeed pleased me much at the first sight but less impressed the rest of our household who now see as many beauties in it as i do myself <\s>
<s> havill the water colour painter was much pleased with these things he is painting at ambleside and has done a view of rydal water looking down upon it from rydal park of which i should like to know your opinion it will be exhibited in the spring in the water colour exhibition <\s>
<s> i have purchased a black lead pencil sketch of mr <\s>
<s> green of ambleside which i think has great merit the materials being uncommonly picturesque and well put together i should dearly like to have the same subject it is the cottage at glencoign by ulleswater treated by you <\s>
<s> in the poem i have just written you will find one situation which if the work should ever become familiarly known would furnish as fine a subject for a picture as any thing i remember in poetry ancient or modern <\s>
<s> i need not mention what it is as when you read the poem you cannot miss it <\s>
<s> we have at last had by the same post two letters from coleridge long and melancholy and also from keswick an account so depressing as to the state of his health that i should have set off immediately to london to see him if i had not myself been confined by indisposition <\s>

<s> wordsworth 32 32 memoirs vol <\s>
<s> i am well aware how far it would seem to many i over rate my own exertions when i speak in this way in direct connection with the volume i have just made public <\s>
<s> i am not however afraid of such censure insignificant as probably the majority of those poems would appear to very respectable persons <\s>
<s> i do not mean london wits and witlings for these have too many foul passions about them to be respectable even if they had more intellect than the benign laws of providence will allow to such a heartless existence as theirs is but grave kindly natured worthy persons who would be pleased if they could <\s>
<s> i hope that these volumes are not without some recommendations even for readers of this class but their imagination has slept and the voice which is the voice of my poetry without imagination cannot be heard <\s>
<s> leaving these i was going to say a word to such readers as mr <\s>
<s> such how would he be offended if he knew i considered him only as a representative of a class and not an unique <\s>
<s> that so many trifling things should be admitted to obstruct the view of those that have merit <\s>
<s> now let this candid judge take by way of example the sonnets which probably with the exception of two or three other poems for which i will not contend appear to him the most trifling as they are the shortest <\s>
<s> i would say to him omitting things of higher consideration there is one thing which must strike you at once if you will only read these poems that those to liberty at least have a connection with or a bearing upon each other and therefore if individually they want weight perhaps as a body they may not be so deficient <\s>
<s> at least this ought to induce you to suspend your judgment and qualify it so far as to allow that the writer aims at least at comprehensiveness <\s>
<s> but dropping this i would boldly say at once that these sonnets while they each fix the attention upon some important sentiment separately considered do at the same time collectively make a poem on the subject of civil liberty and national independence which either for simplicity of style or grandeur of moral sentiment is alas <\s>
<s> likely to have few parallels in the poetry of the present day <\s>
<s> again turn to the moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects <\s>
<s> this is poetic and essentially poetic <\s>
<s> because it is creative <\s>
<s> but i am wasting words for it is nothing more than you know and if said to those for whom it is intended it would not be understood <\s>
<s> i see by your last letter that mrs <\s>
<s> fermor has entered into the spirit of these moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> your transcript from her letter gave me the greatest pleasure but i must say that even she has something yet to receive from me <\s>
<s> i say this with confidence from her thinking that i have fallen below myself in the sonnet beginning with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh <\s>
<s> as to the other which she objects to i will only observe that there is a misprint in the last line but two and though this wilderness for and through this wilderness that makes it unintelligible <\s>
<s> this latter sonnet for many reasons though i do not abandon it i will not now speak of but upon the other i could say something important in conversation and will attempt now to illustrate it by a comment which i feel will be inadequate to convey my meaning <\s>
<s> there is scarcely one of my poems which does not aim to direct the attention to some moral sentiment or to some general principle or law of thought or of our intellectual constitution <\s>
<s> for instance in the present case who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects of which it either cannot make one whole or from which it cannot single out one individual whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided among or distracted by a multitude <\s>
<s> after a certain time we must either select one image or object which must put out of view the rest wholly or must subordinate them to itself while it stands forth as a head how glowed the firmament with living sapphires <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host rode brightest till the moon rising in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unveiled her peerless light and o'er the dark her silver mantle threw <\s>
<s> having laid this down as a general principle take the case before us <\s>
<s> i am represented in the sonnet as casting my eyes over the sea sprinkled with a multitude of ships like the heavens with stars <\s>
<s> my mind may be supposed to float up and down among them in a kind of dreamy indifference with respect either to this or that one only in a pleasurable state of feeling with respect to the whole prospect <\s>
<s> this continued till that feeling may be supposed to have passed away and a kind of comparative listlessness or apathy to have succeeded as at this line some veering up and down one knew not why <\s>
<s> all at once while i am in this state comes forth an object an individual and my mind sleepy and unfixed is awakened and fastened in a moment <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host is a poetical object because the glory of his own nature gives him the pre eminence the moment he appears <\s>
<s> he calls forth the poetic faculty receiving its exertions as a tribute <\s>
<s> but this ship in the sonnet may in a manner still more appropriate be said to come upon a mission of the poetic spirit because in its own appearance and attributes it is barely sufficiently distinguished to rouse the creative faculty of the human mind to exertions at all times welcome but doubly so when they come upon us when in a state of remissness <\s>
<s> the mind being once fixed and roused all the rest comes from itself it is merely a lordly ship nothing more this ship was nought to me nor i to her yet i pursued her with a lover's look <\s>
<s> my mind wantons with grateful joy in the exercise of its own powers and loving its own creation this ship to all the rest i did prefer making her a sovereign or a regent and thus giving body and life to all the rest mingling up this idea with fondness and praise where she comes the winds must stir and concluding the whole with on went she and due north her journey took thus taking up again the reader with whom i began letting him know how long i must have watched this favourite vessel and inviting him to rest his mind as mine is resting <\s>
<s> having said so much upon mere fourteen lines which mrs <\s>
<s> fermor did not approve i cannot but add a word or two upon my satisfaction in finding that my mind has so much in common with hers and that we participate so many of each other's pleasures <\s>
<s> i collect this from her having singled out the two little poems the daffodils and the rock crowned with snowdrops <\s>
<s> i am sure that whoever is much pleased with either of these quiet and tender delineations must be fitted to walk through the recesses of my poetry with delight and will there recognise at every turn something or other in which and over which it has that property and right which knowledge and love confer <\s>

<s> i am sure my dear lady beaumont if you attach any importance to it it can only be from an apprehension that it may affect me upon which i have already set you at ease or from a fear that this present blame is ominous of their future or final destiny <\s>

<s> but this ship in the sonnet may in a manner still more appropriate be said to come upon a mission of the poetic spirit because in its own appearance and attributes it is barely sufficiently distinguished to rouse the creative faculty of the human mind to exertions at all times welcome but doubly so when they come upon us when in a state of remissness <\s>

<s> but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expence of the engraving and that the poem in the estimation of the public would be a weight upon the print <\s>
<s> i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse <\s>
<s> the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it <\s>
<s> thanks for dear lady b s transcript from your friend's letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it <\s>
<s> instances of what i mean says your friend are to be found in a poem on a daisy by the by it is on the daisy a mighty difference and on daffodils reflected in the water <\s>
<s> is this accurately transcribed by lady beaumont <\s>
<s> if it be what shall we think of criticism or judgment founded upon and exemplified by a poem which must have been so inattentively perused <\s>

<s> beneath the trees ten thousand dancing in the breeze <\s>

<s> and let me ask your friend how it is possible for flowers to be reflected in water where there are waves <\s>
<s> they may indeed in still water but the very object of my poem is the trouble or agitation both of the flowers and the water <\s>
<s> i must needs respect the understanding of every one honoured by your friendship but sincerity compels me to say that my poems must be more nearly looked at before they can give rise to any remarks of much value even from the strongest minds <\s>
<s> with respect to this individual poem lady b <\s>

<s> what then shall we say <\s>
<s> why let the poet first consult his own heart as i have done and leave the rest to posterity to i hope an improving posterity <\s>
<s> the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent <\s>
<s> in short in your friend's letter i am condemned for the very thing for which i ought to have been praised viz that i have not written down to the level of superficial observers and unthinking minds <\s>

<s> and for our own parts we like them better every day this in particular is the case with the small picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton which indeed pleased me much at the first sight but less impressed the rest of our household who now see as many beauties in it as i do myself <\s>
<s> havill the water colour painter was much pleased with these things he is painting at ambleside and has done a view of rydal water looking down upon it from rydal park of which i should like to know your opinion it will be exhibited in the spring in the water colour exhibition <\s>

<s> we have at last had by the same post two letters from coleridge long and melancholy and also from keswick an account so depressing as to the state of his health that i should have set off immediately to london to see him if i had not myself been confined by indisposition <\s>

<s> at least this ought to induce you to suspend your judgment and qualify it so far as to allow that the writer aims at least at comprehensiveness <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i am quite delighted to hear of your picture for peter bell i was much pleased with the sketch and i have no doubt that the picture will surpass it as far as a picture ought to do <\s>
<s> i long much to see it <\s>
<s> i should approve of any engraver approved by you <\s>
<s> but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expence of the engraving and that the poem in the estimation of the public would be a weight upon the print <\s>
<s> i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse <\s>
<s> the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it <\s>
<s> thanks for dear lady b s transcript from your friend's letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it <\s>
<s> instances of what i mean says your friend are to be found in a poem on a daisy by the by it is on the daisy a mighty difference and on daffodils reflected in the water <\s>
<s> is this accurately transcribed by lady beaumont <\s>
<s> if it be what shall we think of criticism or judgment founded upon and exemplified by a poem which must have been so inattentively perused <\s>
<s> my language is precise and therefore it would be false modesty to charge myself with blame <\s>
<s> beneath the trees ten thousand dancing in the breeze <\s>
<s> the waves beside them danced but they outdid the sparkling waves in glee <\s>
<s> can expression be more distinct <\s>
<s> and let me ask your friend how it is possible for flowers to be reflected in water where there are waves <\s>
<s> they may indeed in still water but the very object of my poem is the trouble or agitation both of the flowers and the water <\s>
<s> i must needs respect the understanding of every one honoured by your friendship but sincerity compels me to say that my poems must be more nearly looked at before they can give rise to any remarks of much value even from the strongest minds <\s>
<s> with respect to this individual poem lady b <\s>
<s> will recollect how mrs <\s>
<s> fermor expressed herself upon it <\s>
<s> a letter also was sent to me addressed to a friend of mine and by him communicated to me in which this identical poem was singled out for fervent approbation <\s>
<s> what then shall we say <\s>
<s> why let the poet first consult his own heart as i have done and leave the rest to posterity to i hope an improving posterity <\s>
<s> the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent <\s>
<s> in short in your friend's letter i am condemned for the very thing for which i ought to have been praised viz that i have not written down to the level of superficial observers and unthinking minds <\s>
<s> every great poet is a teacher i wish either to be considered as a teacher or as nothing <\s>
<s> to turn to a more pleasing subject <\s>
<s> have you painted anything else beside this picture from peter bell <\s>
<s> your two oil paintings and indeed everything i have of yours have been much admired by the artists who have seen them <\s>
<s> and for our own parts we like them better every day this in particular is the case with the small picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton which indeed pleased me much at the first sight but less impressed the rest of our household who now see as many beauties in it as i do myself <\s>
<s> havill the water colour painter was much pleased with these things he is painting at ambleside and has done a view of rydal water looking down upon it from rydal park of which i should like to know your opinion it will be exhibited in the spring in the water colour exhibition <\s>
<s> i have purchased a black lead pencil sketch of mr <\s>
<s> green of ambleside which i think has great merit the materials being uncommonly picturesque and well put together i should dearly like to have the same subject it is the cottage at glencoign by ulleswater treated by you <\s>
<s> in the poem i have just written you will find one situation which if the work should ever become familiarly known would furnish as fine a subject for a picture as any thing i remember in poetry ancient or modern <\s>
<s> i need not mention what it is as when you read the poem you cannot miss it <\s>
<s> we have at last had by the same post two letters from coleridge long and melancholy and also from keswick an account so depressing as to the state of his health that i should have set off immediately to london to see him if i had not myself been confined by indisposition <\s>
<s> i hope that davy is by this time perfectly restored to health <\s>

<s> wordsworth 32 32 memoirs vol <\s>
<s> i am well aware how far it would seem to many i over rate my own exertions when i speak in this way in direct connection with the volume i have just made public <\s>
<s> i am not however afraid of such censure insignificant as probably the majority of those poems would appear to very respectable persons <\s>
<s> i do not mean london wits and witlings for these have too many foul passions about them to be respectable even if they had more intellect than the benign laws of providence will allow to such a heartless existence as theirs is but grave kindly natured worthy persons who would be pleased if they could <\s>
<s> i hope that these volumes are not without some recommendations even for readers of this class but their imagination has slept and the voice which is the voice of my poetry without imagination cannot be heard <\s>
<s> leaving these i was going to say a word to such readers as mr <\s>
<s> such how would he be offended if he knew i considered him only as a representative of a class and not an unique <\s>
<s> that so many trifling things should be admitted to obstruct the view of those that have merit <\s>
<s> now let this candid judge take by way of example the sonnets which probably with the exception of two or three other poems for which i will not contend appear to him the most trifling as they are the shortest <\s>
<s> i would say to him omitting things of higher consideration there is one thing which must strike you at once if you will only read these poems that those to liberty at least have a connection with or a bearing upon each other and therefore if individually they want weight perhaps as a body they may not be so deficient <\s>
<s> at least this ought to induce you to suspend your judgment and qualify it so far as to allow that the writer aims at least at comprehensiveness <\s>
<s> but dropping this i would boldly say at once that these sonnets while they each fix the attention upon some important sentiment separately considered do at the same time collectively make a poem on the subject of civil liberty and national independence which either for simplicity of style or grandeur of moral sentiment is alas <\s>
<s> likely to have few parallels in the poetry of the present day <\s>
<s> again turn to the moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects <\s>
<s> this is poetic and essentially poetic <\s>
<s> because it is creative <\s>
<s> but i am wasting words for it is nothing more than you know and if said to those for whom it is intended it would not be understood <\s>
<s> i see by your last letter that mrs <\s>
<s> fermor has entered into the spirit of these moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> your transcript from her letter gave me the greatest pleasure but i must say that even she has something yet to receive from me <\s>
<s> i say this with confidence from her thinking that i have fallen below myself in the sonnet beginning with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh <\s>
<s> as to the other which she objects to i will only observe that there is a misprint in the last line but two and though this wilderness for and through this wilderness that makes it unintelligible <\s>
<s> this latter sonnet for many reasons though i do not abandon it i will not now speak of but upon the other i could say something important in conversation and will attempt now to illustrate it by a comment which i feel will be inadequate to convey my meaning <\s>
<s> there is scarcely one of my poems which does not aim to direct the attention to some moral sentiment or to some general principle or law of thought or of our intellectual constitution <\s>
<s> for instance in the present case who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects of which it either cannot make one whole or from which it cannot single out one individual whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided among or distracted by a multitude <\s>
<s> after a certain time we must either select one image or object which must put out of view the rest wholly or must subordinate them to itself while it stands forth as a head how glowed the firmament with living sapphires <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host rode brightest till the moon rising in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unveiled her peerless light and o'er the dark her silver mantle threw <\s>
<s> having laid this down as a general principle take the case before us <\s>
<s> i am represented in the sonnet as casting my eyes over the sea sprinkled with a multitude of ships like the heavens with stars <\s>
<s> my mind may be supposed to float up and down among them in a kind of dreamy indifference with respect either to this or that one only in a pleasurable state of feeling with respect to the whole prospect <\s>
<s> this continued till that feeling may be supposed to have passed away and a kind of comparative listlessness or apathy to have succeeded as at this line some veering up and down one knew not why <\s>
<s> all at once while i am in this state comes forth an object an individual and my mind sleepy and unfixed is awakened and fastened in a moment <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host is a poetical object because the glory of his own nature gives him the pre eminence the moment he appears <\s>
<s> he calls forth the poetic faculty receiving its exertions as a tribute <\s>
<s> but this ship in the sonnet may in a manner still more appropriate be said to come upon a mission of the poetic spirit because in its own appearance and attributes it is barely sufficiently distinguished to rouse the creative faculty of the human mind to exertions at all times welcome but doubly so when they come upon us when in a state of remissness <\s>
<s> the mind being once fixed and roused all the rest comes from itself it is merely a lordly ship nothing more this ship was nought to me nor i to her yet i pursued her with a lover's look <\s>
<s> my mind wantons with grateful joy in the exercise of its own powers and loving its own creation this ship to all the rest i did prefer making her a sovereign or a regent and thus giving body and life to all the rest mingling up this idea with fondness and praise where she comes the winds must stir and concluding the whole with on went she and due north her journey took thus taking up again the reader with whom i began letting him know how long i must have watched this favourite vessel and inviting him to rest his mind as mine is resting <\s>

<s> i do not mean london wits and witlings for these have too many foul passions about them to be respectable even if they had more intellect than the benign laws of providence will allow to such a heartless existence as theirs is but grave kindly natured worthy persons who would be pleased if they could <\s>
<s> i hope that these volumes are not without some recommendations even for readers of this class but their imagination has slept and the voice which is the voice of my poetry without imagination cannot be heard <\s>

<s> now let this candid judge take by way of example the sonnets which probably with the exception of two or three other poems for which i will not contend appear to him the most trifling as they are the shortest <\s>
<s> i would say to him omitting things of higher consideration there is one thing which must strike you at once if you will only read these poems that those to liberty at least have a connection with or a bearing upon each other and therefore if individually they want weight perhaps as a body they may not be so deficient <\s>
<s> at least this ought to induce you to suspend your judgment and qualify it so far as to allow that the writer aims at least at comprehensiveness <\s>

<s> likely to have few parallels in the poetry of the present day <\s>
<s> again turn to the moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects <\s>
<s> this is poetic and essentially poetic <\s>
<s> because it is creative <\s>
<s> but i am wasting words for it is nothing more than you know and if said to those for whom it is intended it would not be understood <\s>
<s> i see by your last letter that mrs <\s>
<s> fermor has entered into the spirit of these moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> your transcript from her letter gave me the greatest pleasure but i must say that even she has something yet to receive from me <\s>
<s> i say this with confidence from her thinking that i have fallen below myself in the sonnet beginning with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh <\s>
<s> as to the other which she objects to i will only observe that there is a misprint in the last line but two and though this wilderness for and through this wilderness that makes it unintelligible <\s>
<s> this latter sonnet for many reasons though i do not abandon it i will not now speak of but upon the other i could say something important in conversation and will attempt now to illustrate it by a comment which i feel will be inadequate to convey my meaning <\s>
<s> there is scarcely one of my poems which does not aim to direct the attention to some moral sentiment or to some general principle or law of thought or of our intellectual constitution <\s>
<s> for instance in the present case who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects of which it either cannot make one whole or from which it cannot single out one individual whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided among or distracted by a multitude <\s>
<s> after a certain time we must either select one image or object which must put out of view the rest wholly or must subordinate them to itself while it stands forth as a head how glowed the firmament with living sapphires <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host rode brightest till the moon rising in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unveiled her peerless light and o'er the dark her silver mantle threw <\s>
<s> having laid this down as a general principle take the case before us <\s>
<s> i am represented in the sonnet as casting my eyes over the sea sprinkled with a multitude of ships like the heavens with stars <\s>
<s> my mind may be supposed to float up and down among them in a kind of dreamy indifference with respect either to this or that one only in a pleasurable state of feeling with respect to the whole prospect <\s>
<s> this continued till that feeling may be supposed to have passed away and a kind of comparative listlessness or apathy to have succeeded as at this line some veering up and down one knew not why <\s>
<s> all at once while i am in this state comes forth an object an individual and my mind sleepy and unfixed is awakened and fastened in a moment <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host is a poetical object because the glory of his own nature gives him the pre eminence the moment he appears <\s>
<s> he calls forth the poetic faculty receiving its exertions as a tribute <\s>
<s> but this ship in the sonnet may in a manner still more appropriate be said to come upon a mission of the poetic spirit because in its own appearance and attributes it is barely sufficiently distinguished to rouse the creative faculty of the human mind to exertions at all times welcome but doubly so when they come upon us when in a state of remissness <\s>
<s> the mind being once fixed and roused all the rest comes from itself it is merely a lordly ship nothing more this ship was nought to me nor i to her yet i pursued her with a lover's look <\s>

<s> i am well aware how far it would seem to many i over rate my own exertions when i speak in this way in direct connection with the volume i have just made public <\s>
<s> i am not however afraid of such censure insignificant as probably the majority of those poems would appear to very respectable persons <\s>
<s> i do not mean london wits and witlings for these have too many foul passions about them to be respectable even if they had more intellect than the benign laws of providence will allow to such a heartless existence as theirs is but grave kindly natured worthy persons who would be pleased if they could <\s>
<s> i hope that these volumes are not without some recommendations even for readers of this class but their imagination has slept and the voice which is the voice of my poetry without imagination cannot be heard <\s>
<s> leaving these i was going to say a word to such readers as mr <\s>
<s> such how would he be offended if he knew i considered him only as a representative of a class and not an unique <\s>
<s> that so many trifling things should be admitted to obstruct the view of those that have merit <\s>
<s> now let this candid judge take by way of example the sonnets which probably with the exception of two or three other poems for which i will not contend appear to him the most trifling as they are the shortest <\s>
<s> i would say to him omitting things of higher consideration there is one thing which must strike you at once if you will only read these poems that those to liberty at least have a connection with or a bearing upon each other and therefore if individually they want weight perhaps as a body they may not be so deficient <\s>
<s> at least this ought to induce you to suspend your judgment and qualify it so far as to allow that the writer aims at least at comprehensiveness <\s>
<s> but dropping this i would boldly say at once that these sonnets while they each fix the attention upon some important sentiment separately considered do at the same time collectively make a poem on the subject of civil liberty and national independence which either for simplicity of style or grandeur of moral sentiment is alas <\s>
<s> likely to have few parallels in the poetry of the present day <\s>
<s> again turn to the moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects <\s>
<s> this is poetic and essentially poetic <\s>
<s> because it is creative <\s>
<s> but i am wasting words for it is nothing more than you know and if said to those for whom it is intended it would not be understood <\s>
<s> i see by your last letter that mrs <\s>
<s> fermor has entered into the spirit of these moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> your transcript from her letter gave me the greatest pleasure but i must say that even she has something yet to receive from me <\s>
<s> i say this with confidence from her thinking that i have fallen below myself in the sonnet beginning with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh <\s>
<s> as to the other which she objects to i will only observe that there is a misprint in the last line but two and though this wilderness for and through this wilderness that makes it unintelligible <\s>
<s> this latter sonnet for many reasons though i do not abandon it i will not now speak of but upon the other i could say something important in conversation and will attempt now to illustrate it by a comment which i feel will be inadequate to convey my meaning <\s>
<s> there is scarcely one of my poems which does not aim to direct the attention to some moral sentiment or to some general principle or law of thought or of our intellectual constitution <\s>
<s> for instance in the present case who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects of which it either cannot make one whole or from which it cannot single out one individual whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided among or distracted by a multitude <\s>

<s> having laid this down as a general principle take the case before us <\s>
<s> i am represented in the sonnet as casting my eyes over the sea sprinkled with a multitude of ships like the heavens with stars <\s>
<s> my mind may be supposed to float up and down among them in a kind of dreamy indifference with respect either to this or that one only in a pleasurable state of feeling with respect to the whole prospect <\s>

<s> hesperus that led the starry host is a poetical object because the glory of his own nature gives him the pre eminence the moment he appears <\s>
<s> he calls forth the poetic faculty receiving its exertions as a tribute <\s>
<s> but this ship in the sonnet may in a manner still more appropriate be said to come upon a mission of the poetic spirit because in its own appearance and attributes it is barely sufficiently distinguished to rouse the creative faculty of the human mind to exertions at all times welcome but doubly so when they come upon us when in a state of remissness <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i am quite delighted to hear of your picture for peter bell i was much pleased with the sketch and i have no doubt that the picture will surpass it as far as a picture ought to do <\s>
<s> i long much to see it <\s>
<s> i should approve of any engraver approved by you <\s>
<s> but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expence of the engraving and that the poem in the estimation of the public would be a weight upon the print <\s>
<s> i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse <\s>
<s> the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it <\s>
<s> thanks for dear lady b s transcript from your friend's letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it <\s>
<s> instances of what i mean says your friend are to be found in a poem on a daisy by the by it is on the daisy a mighty difference and on daffodils reflected in the water <\s>
<s> is this accurately transcribed by lady beaumont <\s>
<s> if it be what shall we think of criticism or judgment founded upon and exemplified by a poem which must have been so inattentively perused <\s>
<s> my language is precise and therefore it would be false modesty to charge myself with blame <\s>
<s> beneath the trees ten thousand dancing in the breeze <\s>
<s> the waves beside them danced but they outdid the sparkling waves in glee <\s>
<s> can expression be more distinct <\s>
<s> and let me ask your friend how it is possible for flowers to be reflected in water where there are waves <\s>
<s> they may indeed in still water but the very object of my poem is the trouble or agitation both of the flowers and the water <\s>
<s> i must needs respect the understanding of every one honoured by your friendship but sincerity compels me to say that my poems must be more nearly looked at before they can give rise to any remarks of much value even from the strongest minds <\s>
<s> with respect to this individual poem lady b <\s>
<s> will recollect how mrs <\s>
<s> fermor expressed herself upon it <\s>
<s> a letter also was sent to me addressed to a friend of mine and by him communicated to me in which this identical poem was singled out for fervent approbation <\s>
<s> what then shall we say <\s>
<s> why let the poet first consult his own heart as i have done and leave the rest to posterity to i hope an improving posterity <\s>
<s> the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent <\s>
<s> in short in your friend's letter i am condemned for the very thing for which i ought to have been praised viz that i have not written down to the level of superficial observers and unthinking minds <\s>
<s> every great poet is a teacher i wish either to be considered as a teacher or as nothing <\s>

<s> your two oil paintings and indeed everything i have of yours have been much admired by the artists who have seen them <\s>
<s> and for our own parts we like them better every day this in particular is the case with the small picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton which indeed pleased me much at the first sight but less impressed the rest of our household who now see as many beauties in it as i do myself <\s>
<s> havill the water colour painter was much pleased with these things he is painting at ambleside and has done a view of rydal water looking down upon it from rydal park of which i should like to know your opinion it will be exhibited in the spring in the water colour exhibition <\s>

<s> green of ambleside which i think has great merit the materials being uncommonly picturesque and well put together i should dearly like to have the same subject it is the cottage at glencoign by ulleswater treated by you <\s>

<s> i need not mention what it is as when you read the poem you cannot miss it <\s>
<s> we have at last had by the same post two letters from coleridge long and melancholy and also from keswick an account so depressing as to the state of his health that i should have set off immediately to london to see him if i had not myself been confined by indisposition <\s>

<s> i long much to see it <\s>
<s> i should approve of any engraver approved by you <\s>
<s> but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expence of the engraving and that the poem in the estimation of the public would be a weight upon the print <\s>
<s> i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse <\s>
<s> the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it <\s>
<s> thanks for dear lady b s transcript from your friend's letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it <\s>
<s> instances of what i mean says your friend are to be found in a poem on a daisy by the by it is on the daisy a mighty difference and on daffodils reflected in the water <\s>
<s> is this accurately transcribed by lady beaumont <\s>
<s> if it be what shall we think of criticism or judgment founded upon and exemplified by a poem which must have been so inattentively perused <\s>

<s> beneath the trees ten thousand dancing in the breeze <\s>

<s> and let me ask your friend how it is possible for flowers to be reflected in water where there are waves <\s>
<s> they may indeed in still water but the very object of my poem is the trouble or agitation both of the flowers and the water <\s>
<s> i must needs respect the understanding of every one honoured by your friendship but sincerity compels me to say that my poems must be more nearly looked at before they can give rise to any remarks of much value even from the strongest minds <\s>
<s> with respect to this individual poem lady b <\s>
<s> will recollect how mrs <\s>
<s> fermor expressed herself upon it <\s>
<s> a letter also was sent to me addressed to a friend of mine and by him communicated to me in which this identical poem was singled out for fervent approbation <\s>
<s> what then shall we say <\s>
<s> why let the poet first consult his own heart as i have done and leave the rest to posterity to i hope an improving posterity <\s>
<s> the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent <\s>
<s> in short in your friend's letter i am condemned for the very thing for which i ought to have been praised viz that i have not written down to the level of superficial observers and unthinking minds <\s>
<s> every great poet is a teacher i wish either to be considered as a teacher or as nothing <\s>
<s> to turn to a more pleasing subject <\s>
<s> have you painted anything else beside this picture from peter bell <\s>
<s> your two oil paintings and indeed everything i have of yours have been much admired by the artists who have seen them <\s>
<s> and for our own parts we like them better every day this in particular is the case with the small picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton which indeed pleased me much at the first sight but less impressed the rest of our household who now see as many beauties in it as i do myself <\s>
<s> havill the water colour painter was much pleased with these things he is painting at ambleside and has done a view of rydal water looking down upon it from rydal park of which i should like to know your opinion it will be exhibited in the spring in the water colour exhibition <\s>
<s> i have purchased a black lead pencil sketch of mr <\s>
<s> green of ambleside which i think has great merit the materials being uncommonly picturesque and well put together i should dearly like to have the same subject it is the cottage at glencoign by ulleswater treated by you <\s>
<s> in the poem i have just written you will find one situation which if the work should ever become familiarly known would furnish as fine a subject for a picture as any thing i remember in poetry ancient or modern <\s>
<s> i need not mention what it is as when you read the poem you cannot miss it <\s>
<s> we have at last had by the same post two letters from coleridge long and melancholy and also from keswick an account so depressing as to the state of his health that i should have set off immediately to london to see him if i had not myself been confined by indisposition <\s>

<s> i am well aware how far it would seem to many i over rate my own exertions when i speak in this way in direct connection with the volume i have just made public <\s>
<s> i am not however afraid of such censure insignificant as probably the majority of those poems would appear to very respectable persons <\s>
<s> i do not mean london wits and witlings for these have too many foul passions about them to be respectable even if they had more intellect than the benign laws of providence will allow to such a heartless existence as theirs is but grave kindly natured worthy persons who would be pleased if they could <\s>
<s> i hope that these volumes are not without some recommendations even for readers of this class but their imagination has slept and the voice which is the voice of my poetry without imagination cannot be heard <\s>
<s> leaving these i was going to say a word to such readers as mr <\s>
<s> such how would he be offended if he knew i considered him only as a representative of a class and not an unique <\s>
<s> that so many trifling things should be admitted to obstruct the view of those that have merit <\s>
<s> now let this candid judge take by way of example the sonnets which probably with the exception of two or three other poems for which i will not contend appear to him the most trifling as they are the shortest <\s>
<s> i would say to him omitting things of higher consideration there is one thing which must strike you at once if you will only read these poems that those to liberty at least have a connection with or a bearing upon each other and therefore if individually they want weight perhaps as a body they may not be so deficient <\s>
<s> at least this ought to induce you to suspend your judgment and qualify it so far as to allow that the writer aims at least at comprehensiveness <\s>
<s> but dropping this i would boldly say at once that these sonnets while they each fix the attention upon some important sentiment separately considered do at the same time collectively make a poem on the subject of civil liberty and national independence which either for simplicity of style or grandeur of moral sentiment is alas <\s>
<s> likely to have few parallels in the poetry of the present day <\s>
<s> again turn to the moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects <\s>
<s> this is poetic and essentially poetic <\s>
<s> because it is creative <\s>
<s> but i am wasting words for it is nothing more than you know and if said to those for whom it is intended it would not be understood <\s>
<s> i see by your last letter that mrs <\s>
<s> fermor has entered into the spirit of these moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> your transcript from her letter gave me the greatest pleasure but i must say that even she has something yet to receive from me <\s>
<s> i say this with confidence from her thinking that i have fallen below myself in the sonnet beginning with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh <\s>
<s> as to the other which she objects to i will only observe that there is a misprint in the last line but two and though this wilderness for and through this wilderness that makes it unintelligible <\s>
<s> this latter sonnet for many reasons though i do not abandon it i will not now speak of but upon the other i could say something important in conversation and will attempt now to illustrate it by a comment which i feel will be inadequate to convey my meaning <\s>
<s> there is scarcely one of my poems which does not aim to direct the attention to some moral sentiment or to some general principle or law of thought or of our intellectual constitution <\s>
<s> for instance in the present case who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects of which it either cannot make one whole or from which it cannot single out one individual whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided among or distracted by a multitude <\s>
<s> after a certain time we must either select one image or object which must put out of view the rest wholly or must subordinate them to itself while it stands forth as a head how glowed the firmament with living sapphires <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i am quite delighted to hear of your picture for peter bell i was much pleased with the sketch and i have no doubt that the picture will surpass it as far as a picture ought to do <\s>
<s> i long much to see it <\s>
<s> i should approve of any engraver approved by you <\s>
<s> but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expence of the engraving and that the poem in the estimation of the public would be a weight upon the print <\s>
<s> i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse <\s>
<s> the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it <\s>
<s> thanks for dear lady b s transcript from your friend's letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it <\s>
<s> instances of what i mean says your friend are to be found in a poem on a daisy by the by it is on the daisy a mighty difference and on daffodils reflected in the water <\s>
<s> is this accurately transcribed by lady beaumont <\s>
<s> if it be what shall we think of criticism or judgment founded upon and exemplified by a poem which must have been so inattentively perused <\s>
<s> my language is precise and therefore it would be false modesty to charge myself with blame <\s>
<s> beneath the trees ten thousand dancing in the breeze <\s>
<s> the waves beside them danced but they outdid the sparkling waves in glee <\s>
<s> can expression be more distinct <\s>
<s> and let me ask your friend how it is possible for flowers to be reflected in water where there are waves <\s>
<s> they may indeed in still water but the very object of my poem is the trouble or agitation both of the flowers and the water <\s>
<s> i must needs respect the understanding of every one honoured by your friendship but sincerity compels me to say that my poems must be more nearly looked at before they can give rise to any remarks of much value even from the strongest minds <\s>
<s> with respect to this individual poem lady b <\s>
<s> will recollect how mrs <\s>
<s> fermor expressed herself upon it <\s>
<s> a letter also was sent to me addressed to a friend of mine and by him communicated to me in which this identical poem was singled out for fervent approbation <\s>
<s> what then shall we say <\s>
<s> why let the poet first consult his own heart as i have done and leave the rest to posterity to i hope an improving posterity <\s>
<s> the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent <\s>
<s> in short in your friend's letter i am condemned for the very thing for which i ought to have been praised viz that i have not written down to the level of superficial observers and unthinking minds <\s>
<s> every great poet is a teacher i wish either to be considered as a teacher or as nothing <\s>
<s> to turn to a more pleasing subject <\s>
<s> have you painted anything else beside this picture from peter bell <\s>
<s> your two oil paintings and indeed everything i have of yours have been much admired by the artists who have seen them <\s>
<s> and for our own parts we like them better every day this in particular is the case with the small picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton which indeed pleased me much at the first sight but less impressed the rest of our household who now see as many beauties in it as i do myself <\s>
<s> havill the water colour painter was much pleased with these things he is painting at ambleside and has done a view of rydal water looking down upon it from rydal park of which i should like to know your opinion it will be exhibited in the spring in the water colour exhibition <\s>
<s> i have purchased a black lead pencil sketch of mr <\s>
<s> green of ambleside which i think has great merit the materials being uncommonly picturesque and well put together i should dearly like to have the same subject it is the cottage at glencoign by ulleswater treated by you <\s>
<s> in the poem i have just written you will find one situation which if the work should ever become familiarly known would furnish as fine a subject for a picture as any thing i remember in poetry ancient or modern <\s>
<s> i need not mention what it is as when you read the poem you cannot miss it <\s>
<s> we have at last had by the same post two letters from coleridge long and melancholy and also from keswick an account so depressing as to the state of his health that i should have set off immediately to london to see him if i had not myself been confined by indisposition <\s>

<s> wordsworth 32 32 memoirs vol <\s>
<s> i am well aware how far it would seem to many i over rate my own exertions when i speak in this way in direct connection with the volume i have just made public <\s>
<s> i am not however afraid of such censure insignificant as probably the majority of those poems would appear to very respectable persons <\s>
<s> i do not mean london wits and witlings for these have too many foul passions about them to be respectable even if they had more intellect than the benign laws of providence will allow to such a heartless existence as theirs is but grave kindly natured worthy persons who would be pleased if they could <\s>
<s> i hope that these volumes are not without some recommendations even for readers of this class but their imagination has slept and the voice which is the voice of my poetry without imagination cannot be heard <\s>
<s> leaving these i was going to say a word to such readers as mr <\s>
<s> such how would he be offended if he knew i considered him only as a representative of a class and not an unique <\s>
<s> that so many trifling things should be admitted to obstruct the view of those that have merit <\s>
<s> now let this candid judge take by way of example the sonnets which probably with the exception of two or three other poems for which i will not contend appear to him the most trifling as they are the shortest <\s>
<s> i would say to him omitting things of higher consideration there is one thing which must strike you at once if you will only read these poems that those to liberty at least have a connection with or a bearing upon each other and therefore if individually they want weight perhaps as a body they may not be so deficient <\s>
<s> at least this ought to induce you to suspend your judgment and qualify it so far as to allow that the writer aims at least at comprehensiveness <\s>
<s> but dropping this i would boldly say at once that these sonnets while they each fix the attention upon some important sentiment separately considered do at the same time collectively make a poem on the subject of civil liberty and national independence which either for simplicity of style or grandeur of moral sentiment is alas <\s>
<s> likely to have few parallels in the poetry of the present day <\s>
<s> again turn to the moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects <\s>
<s> this is poetic and essentially poetic <\s>
<s> because it is creative <\s>
<s> but i am wasting words for it is nothing more than you know and if said to those for whom it is intended it would not be understood <\s>
<s> i see by your last letter that mrs <\s>
<s> fermor has entered into the spirit of these moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> your transcript from her letter gave me the greatest pleasure but i must say that even she has something yet to receive from me <\s>
<s> i say this with confidence from her thinking that i have fallen below myself in the sonnet beginning with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh <\s>
<s> as to the other which she objects to i will only observe that there is a misprint in the last line but two and though this wilderness for and through this wilderness that makes it unintelligible <\s>
<s> this latter sonnet for many reasons though i do not abandon it i will not now speak of but upon the other i could say something important in conversation and will attempt now to illustrate it by a comment which i feel will be inadequate to convey my meaning <\s>
<s> there is scarcely one of my poems which does not aim to direct the attention to some moral sentiment or to some general principle or law of thought or of our intellectual constitution <\s>
<s> for instance in the present case who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects of which it either cannot make one whole or from which it cannot single out one individual whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided among or distracted by a multitude <\s>
<s> after a certain time we must either select one image or object which must put out of view the rest wholly or must subordinate them to itself while it stands forth as a head how glowed the firmament with living sapphires <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host rode brightest till the moon rising in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unveiled her peerless light and o'er the dark her silver mantle threw <\s>
<s> having laid this down as a general principle take the case before us <\s>
<s> i am represented in the sonnet as casting my eyes over the sea sprinkled with a multitude of ships like the heavens with stars <\s>
<s> my mind may be supposed to float up and down among them in a kind of dreamy indifference with respect either to this or that one only in a pleasurable state of feeling with respect to the whole prospect <\s>
<s> this continued till that feeling may be supposed to have passed away and a kind of comparative listlessness or apathy to have succeeded as at this line some veering up and down one knew not why <\s>
<s> all at once while i am in this state comes forth an object an individual and my mind sleepy and unfixed is awakened and fastened in a moment <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host is a poetical object because the glory of his own nature gives him the pre eminence the moment he appears <\s>
<s> he calls forth the poetic faculty receiving its exertions as a tribute <\s>
<s> but this ship in the sonnet may in a manner still more appropriate be said to come upon a mission of the poetic spirit because in its own appearance and attributes it is barely sufficiently distinguished to rouse the creative faculty of the human mind to exertions at all times welcome but doubly so when they come upon us when in a state of remissness <\s>
<s> the mind being once fixed and roused all the rest comes from itself it is merely a lordly ship nothing more this ship was nought to me nor i to her yet i pursued her with a lover's look <\s>
<s> my mind wantons with grateful joy in the exercise of its own powers and loving its own creation this ship to all the rest i did prefer making her a sovereign or a regent and thus giving body and life to all the rest mingling up this idea with fondness and praise where she comes the winds must stir and concluding the whole with on went she and due north her journey took thus taking up again the reader with whom i began letting him know how long i must have watched this favourite vessel and inviting him to rest his mind as mine is resting <\s>
<s> having said so much upon mere fourteen lines which mrs <\s>
<s> fermor did not approve i cannot but add a word or two upon my satisfaction in finding that my mind has so much in common with hers and that we participate so many of each other's pleasures <\s>
<s> i collect this from her having singled out the two little poems the daffodils and the rock crowned with snowdrops <\s>
<s> i am sure that whoever is much pleased with either of these quiet and tender delineations must be fitted to walk through the recesses of my poetry with delight and will there recognise at every turn something or other in which and over which it has that property and right which knowledge and love confer <\s>

<s> i am sure my dear lady beaumont if you attach any importance to it it can only be from an apprehension that it may affect me upon which i have already set you at ease or from a fear that this present blame is ominous of their future or final destiny <\s>

<s> but this ship in the sonnet may in a manner still more appropriate be said to come upon a mission of the poetic spirit because in its own appearance and attributes it is barely sufficiently distinguished to rouse the creative faculty of the human mind to exertions at all times welcome but doubly so when they come upon us when in a state of remissness <\s>

<s> there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects <\s>
<s> this is poetic and essentially poetic <\s>
<s> because it is creative <\s>
<s> but i am wasting words for it is nothing more than you know and if said to those for whom it is intended it would not be understood <\s>
<s> i see by your last letter that mrs <\s>
<s> fermor has entered into the spirit of these moods of my own mind <\s>
<s> your transcript from her letter gave me the greatest pleasure but i must say that even she has something yet to receive from me <\s>
<s> i say this with confidence from her thinking that i have fallen below myself in the sonnet beginning with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh <\s>
<s> as to the other which she objects to i will only observe that there is a misprint in the last line but two and though this wilderness for and through this wilderness that makes it unintelligible <\s>
<s> this latter sonnet for many reasons though i do not abandon it i will not now speak of but upon the other i could say something important in conversation and will attempt now to illustrate it by a comment which i feel will be inadequate to convey my meaning <\s>
<s> there is scarcely one of my poems which does not aim to direct the attention to some moral sentiment or to some general principle or law of thought or of our intellectual constitution <\s>
<s> for instance in the present case who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects of which it either cannot make one whole or from which it cannot single out one individual whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided among or distracted by a multitude <\s>
<s> after a certain time we must either select one image or object which must put out of view the rest wholly or must subordinate them to itself while it stands forth as a head how glowed the firmament with living sapphires <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host rode brightest till the moon rising in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unveiled her peerless light and o'er the dark her silver mantle threw <\s>
<s> having laid this down as a general principle take the case before us <\s>
<s> i am represented in the sonnet as casting my eyes over the sea sprinkled with a multitude of ships like the heavens with stars <\s>
<s> my mind may be supposed to float up and down among them in a kind of dreamy indifference with respect either to this or that one only in a pleasurable state of feeling with respect to the whole prospect <\s>
<s> this continued till that feeling may be supposed to have passed away and a kind of comparative listlessness or apathy to have succeeded as at this line some veering up and down one knew not why <\s>
<s> all at once while i am in this state comes forth an object an individual and my mind sleepy and unfixed is awakened and fastened in a moment <\s>
<s> hesperus that led the starry host is a poetical object because the glory of his own nature gives him the pre eminence the moment he appears <\s>
<s> he calls forth the poetic faculty receiving its exertions as a tribute <\s>
<s> but this ship in the sonnet may in a manner still more appropriate be said to come upon a mission of the poetic spirit because in its own appearance and attributes it is barely sufficiently distinguished to rouse the creative faculty of the human mind to exertions at all times welcome but doubly so when they come upon us when in a state of remissness <\s>
<s> the mind being once fixed and roused all the rest comes from itself it is merely a lordly ship nothing more this ship was nought to me nor i to her yet i pursued her with a lover's look <\s>
<s> my mind wantons with grateful joy in the exercise of its own powers and loving its own creation this ship to all the rest i did prefer making her a sovereign or a regent and thus giving body and life to all the rest mingling up this idea with fondness and praise where she comes the winds must stir and concluding the whole with on went she and due north her journey took thus taking up again the reader with whom i began letting him know how long i must have watched this favourite vessel and inviting him to rest his mind as mine is resting <\s>
<s> having said so much upon mere fourteen lines which mrs <\s>
<s> fermor did not approve i cannot but add a word or two upon my satisfaction in finding that my mind has so much in common with hers and that we participate so many of each other's pleasures <\s>
<s> i collect this from her having singled out the two little poems the daffodils and the rock crowned with snowdrops <\s>
<s> i am sure that whoever is much pleased with either of these quiet and tender delineations must be fitted to walk through the recesses of my poetry with delight and will there recognise at every turn something or other in which and over which it has that property and right which knowledge and love confer <\s>
<s> the line come blessed barrier c <\s>
<s> in the sonnet upon sleep which mrs <\s>
<s> points out had before been mentioned to me by coleridge and indeed by almost every body who had heard it as eminently beautiful <\s>
<s> my letter as this second sheet which i am obliged to take admonishes me is growing to an enormous length and yet saving that i have expressed my calm confidence that these poems will live i have said nothing which has a particular application to the object of it which was to remove all disquiet from your mind on account of the condemnation they may at present incur from that portion of my contemporaries who are called the public <\s>
<s> i am sure my dear lady beaumont if you attach any importance to it it can only be from an apprehension that it may affect me upon which i have already set you at ease or from a fear that this present blame is ominous of their future or final destiny <\s>
<s> if this be the case your tenderness for me betrays you <\s>
<s> be assured that the decision of these persons has nothing to do with the question they are altogether incompetent judges <\s>
<s> these people in the senseless hurry of their idle lives do not read books they merely snatch a glance at them that they may talk about them <\s>
<s> and even if this were not so never forget what i believe was observed to you by coleridge that every great and original writer in proportion as he is great or original must himself create the taste by which he is to be relished he must teach the art by which he is to be seen this in a certain degree even to all persons however wise and pure may be their lives and however unvitiated their taste <\s>
<s> but for those who dip into books in order to give an opinion of them or talk about them to take up an opinion for this multitude of unhappy and misguided and misguiding beings an entire regeneration must be produced and if this be possible it must be a work of time <\s>
<s> to conclude my ears are stone dead to this idle buzz and my flesh as insensible as iron to these petty stings and after what i have said i am sure yours will be the same <\s>
<s> i doubt not that you will share with me an invincible confidence that my writings and among them these little poems will co operate with the benign tendencies in human nature and society wherever found and that they will in their degree be efficacious in making men wiser better and happier <\s>
<s> i will not apologise for this letter though its length demands an apology <\s>
<s> believe me eagerly wishing for the happy day when i shall see you and sir george here most affectionately yours w <\s>
<s> do not hurry your coming hither on our account my sister regrets that she did not press this upon you as you say in your letter we cannot possibly come before the first week in june from which we infer that your kindness will induce you to make sacrifices for our sakes <\s>
<s> whatever pleasure we may have in thinking of grasmere we have no impatience to be gone and think with full as much regret of leaving coleorton <\s>
<s> i had for myself indeed a wish to be at grasmere with as much of the summer before me as might be but to this i attach no importance whatever as far as the gratification of that wish interferes with any inclination or duty of yours <\s>

<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george i am quite delighted to hear of your picture for peter bell i was much pleased with the sketch and i have no doubt that the picture will surpass it as far as a picture ought to do <\s>
<s> i long much to see it <\s>
<s> i should approve of any engraver approved by you <\s>
<s> but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expence of the engraving and that the poem in the estimation of the public would be a weight upon the print <\s>
<s> i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse <\s>
<s> the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it <\s>
<s> thanks for dear lady b s transcript from your friend's letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it <\s>
<s> instances of what i mean says your friend are to be found in a poem on a daisy by the by it is on the daisy a mighty difference and on daffodils reflected in the water <\s>
<s> is this accurately transcribed by lady beaumont <\s>
<s> if it be what shall we think of criticism or judgment founded upon and exemplified by a poem which must have been so inattentively perused <\s>
<s> my language is precise and therefore it would be false modesty to charge myself with blame <\s>
<s> beneath the trees ten thousand dancing in the breeze <\s>
<s> the waves beside them danced but they outdid the sparkling waves in glee <\s>
<s> can expression be more distinct <\s>
<s> and let me ask your friend how it is possible for flowers to be reflected in water where there are waves <\s>
<s> they may indeed in still water but the very object of my poem is the trouble or agitation both of the flowers and the water <\s>
<s> i must needs respect the understanding of every one honoured by your friendship but sincerity compels me to say that my poems must be more nearly looked at before they can give rise to any remarks of much value even from the strongest minds <\s>
<s> with respect to this individual poem lady b <\s>
<s> will recollect how mrs <\s>
<s> fermor expressed herself upon it <\s>
<s> a letter also was sent to me addressed to a friend of mine and by him communicated to me in which this identical poem was singled out for fervent approbation <\s>
<s> what then shall we say <\s>
<s> why let the poet first consult his own heart as i have done and leave the rest to posterity to i hope an improving posterity <\s>
<s> the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent <\s>
<s> in short in your friend's letter i am condemned for the very thing for which i ought to have been praised viz that i have not written down to the level of superficial observers and unthinking minds <\s>
<s> every great poet is a teacher i wish either to be considered as a teacher or as nothing <\s>
<s> to turn to a more pleasing subject <\s>
<s> have you painted anything else beside this picture from peter bell <\s>
<s> your two oil paintings and indeed everything i have of yours have been much admired by the artists who have seen them <\s>
<s> and for our own parts we like them better every day this in particular is the case with the small picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton which indeed pleased me much at the first sight but less impressed the rest of our household who now see as many beauties in it as i do myself <\s>
<s> havill the water colour painter was much pleased with these things he is painting at ambleside and has done a view of rydal water looking down upon it from rydal park of which i should like to know your opinion it will be exhibited in the spring in the water colour exhibition <\s>
<s> i have purchased a black lead pencil sketch of mr <\s>
<s> green of ambleside which i think has great merit the materials being uncommonly picturesque and well put together i should dearly like to have the same subject it is the cottage at glencoign by ulleswater treated by you <\s>
<s> in the poem i have just written you will find one situation which if the work should ever become familiarly known would furnish as fine a subject for a picture as any thing i remember in poetry ancient or modern <\s>
<s> i need not mention what it is as when you read the poem you cannot miss it <\s>
<s> we have at last had by the same post two letters from coleridge long and melancholy and also from keswick an account so depressing as to the state of his health that i should have set off immediately to london to see him if i had not myself been confined by indisposition <\s>
<s> i hope that davy is by this time perfectly restored to health <\s>
