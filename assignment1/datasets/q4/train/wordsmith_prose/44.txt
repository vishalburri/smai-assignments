<s> of building and gardening and laying out of grounds <\s>
<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george i was very glad to learn that you had room for me at coleorton and far more so that your health was so much mended <\s>
<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>
<s> but she is doing well again and my sister will write very soon <\s>
<s> lady beaumont inquired how game might be sent us <\s>
<s> there is a direct conveyance from manchester to kendal by the mail and a parcel directed for me to be delivered at kendal immediately to john brockbank ambleside postman would i dare say find its way to us expeditiously enough only you will have the goodness to mention in your letters when you do send anything otherwise we may not be aware of any mistake <\s>
<s> i am glad the houbraken will be acceptable and will send it any way you shall think proper though perhaps as it would only make a small parcel there might be some risk in trusting it to the waggon or mail unless it could be conveniently inquired after <\s>
<s> no news of coleridge <\s>
<s> the length of this letter is quite formidable forgive it <\s>
<s> farewell and believe me my dear sir george your truly affectionate friend w <\s>
<s> wordsworth 35 35 memoirs vol <\s>
<s> 345 54 with very important additions from the original <\s>
<s> of the inscriptions at coleorton <\s>
<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george had there been room at the end of the small avenue of lime trees for planting a spacious circle of the same trees the urn might have been placed in the centre with the inscription thus altered ye lime trees ranged around this hallowed urn shoot forth with lively power at spring's return <\s>
<s> here may some painter sit in future days some future poet meditate his lays <\s>
<s> not mindless of that distant age renowned when inspiration hovered o'er this ground the haunt of him who sang how spear and shield in civil conflict met on bosworth field and of that famous youth full soon removed from earth by mighty shakspeare's self approved <\s>
<s> fletcher's associate jonson's friend beloved <\s>
<s> the first couplet of the above as it before stood would have appeared ludicrous if the stone had remained after the tree might have been gone <\s>
<s> the couplet relating to the household virtues did not accord with the painter and the poet the former being allegorical figures the latter living men <\s>
<s> what follows i composed yesterday morning thinking there might be no impropriety in placing it so as to be visible only to a person sitting within the niche which we hollowed out of the sandstone in the winter garden <\s>
<s> i am told that this is in the present form of the niche impossible but i shall be most ready when i come to coleorton to scoop out a place for it if lady beaumont think it worth while <\s>
<s> oft is the medal faithful to its trust when temples columns towers are laid in dust and tis a common ordinance of fate that things obscure and small outlive the great <\s>
<s> these inscriptions have all one fault they are too long but i was unable to do justice to the thoughts in less room <\s>
<s> the second has brought sir john beaumont and his brother francis so lively to my mind that i recur to the plan of republishing the former's poems perhaps in connection with those of francis <\s>
<s> could any further search be made after the crown of thorns <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i was very glad to learn that you had room for me at coleorton and far more so that your health was so much mended <\s>
<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>
<s> but she is doing well again and my sister will write very soon <\s>
<s> lady beaumont inquired how game might be sent us <\s>
<s> there is a direct conveyance from manchester to kendal by the mail and a parcel directed for me to be delivered at kendal immediately to john brockbank ambleside postman would i dare say find its way to us expeditiously enough only you will have the goodness to mention in your letters when you do send anything otherwise we may not be aware of any mistake <\s>
<s> i am glad the houbraken will be acceptable and will send it any way you shall think proper though perhaps as it would only make a small parcel there might be some risk in trusting it to the waggon or mail unless it could be conveniently inquired after <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i was very glad to learn that you had room for me at coleorton and far more so that your health was so much mended <\s>
<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>
<s> but she is doing well again and my sister will write very soon <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>

<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>

<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>
<s> but she is doing well again and my sister will write very soon <\s>
<s> lady beaumont inquired how game might be sent us <\s>
<s> there is a direct conveyance from manchester to kendal by the mail and a parcel directed for me to be delivered at kendal immediately to john brockbank ambleside postman would i dare say find its way to us expeditiously enough only you will have the goodness to mention in your letters when you do send anything otherwise we may not be aware of any mistake <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>

<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>

<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>

<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>

<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>

<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>

<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>

<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>

<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i was very glad to learn that you had room for me at coleorton and far more so that your health was so much mended <\s>
<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>

<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>

<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>

<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>

<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>

<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>

<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>

<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>

<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>

<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>

<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i was very glad to learn that you had room for me at coleorton and far more so that your health was so much mended <\s>
<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>
<s> but she is doing well again and my sister will write very soon <\s>
<s> lady beaumont inquired how game might be sent us <\s>

<s> i am glad the houbraken will be acceptable and will send it any way you shall think proper though perhaps as it would only make a small parcel there might be some risk in trusting it to the waggon or mail unless it could be conveniently inquired after <\s>

<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george i was very glad to learn that you had room for me at coleorton and far more so that your health was so much mended <\s>
<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>
<s> but she is doing well again and my sister will write very soon <\s>
<s> lady beaumont inquired how game might be sent us <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>

<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>

<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>
<s> but she is doing well again and my sister will write very soon <\s>
<s> lady beaumont inquired how game might be sent us <\s>
<s> there is a direct conveyance from manchester to kendal by the mail and a parcel directed for me to be delivered at kendal immediately to john brockbank ambleside postman would i dare say find its way to us expeditiously enough only you will have the goodness to mention in your letters when you do send anything otherwise we may not be aware of any mistake <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>

<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>

<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>

<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>

<s> lady beaumont's last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves <\s>
<s> i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind <\s>
<s> with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony <\s>
<s> setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong <\s>
<s> indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle <\s>
<s> in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of people's minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief <\s>
<s> such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting <\s>
<s> yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired <\s>
<s> the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c <\s>
<s> so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of <\s>
<s> this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards <\s>
<s> painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste <\s>
<s> error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one <\s>
<s> it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances <\s>
<s> we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature <\s>
<s> let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences <\s>
<s> the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to <\s>
<s> this is contracting a general feeling into a local one <\s>
<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>

<s> besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough <\s>
<s> but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it <\s>
<s> after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature <\s>
<s> surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery <\s>
<s> i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estate this man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowly minded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind <\s>
<s> let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have flourishing fields and happy looking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure ground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her <\s>
<s> if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault <\s>
<s> i am writing now rather for writing's sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect <\s>
<s> i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowther's grounds and heaven knows what <\s>
<s> i have had before me the tremendously long ell wide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none <\s>
<s> thence i pass'd to our neighbour lord lowther <\s>
<s> you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself <\s>
<s> the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much <\s>
<s> he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man 33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far <\s>
<s> this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at <\s>
<s> see poem to his spade <\s>
<s> you know something of lowther <\s>
<s> i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun <\s>
<s> last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the river side till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith <\s>
<s> this to my great sorrow <\s>
<s> for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love <\s>
<s> this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes <\s>
<s> there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure <\s>
<s> when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday <\s>
<s> i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the river side were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet <\s>
<s> you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me <\s>
<s> and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is this that all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man <\s>
<s> laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life <\s>
<s> no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds <\s>
<s> if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses <\s>
<s> but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer <\s>
<s> what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation <\s>
<s> i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts <\s>
<s> i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village <\s>
<s> of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked <\s>
<s> but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo <\s>
<s> you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation <\s>
<s> in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them <\s>
<s> i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied <\s>
<s> only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself <\s>
<s> lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer <\s>
<s> we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither <\s>
<s> at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without a word about myself <\s>
<s> i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment <\s>
<s> the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes <\s>
<s> i mentioned michael angelo's poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things <\s>
<s> there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue <\s>
<s> i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable <\s>
<s> i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed <\s>
<s> i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me 34 34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c <\s>
<s> i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted <\s>
<s> i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing <\s>
<s> we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day <\s>
<s> but she is doing well again and my sister will write very soon <\s>
<s> lady beaumont inquired how game might be sent us <\s>
<s> there is a direct conveyance from manchester to kendal by the mail and a parcel directed for me to be delivered at kendal immediately to john brockbank ambleside postman would i dare say find its way to us expeditiously enough only you will have the goodness to mention in your letters when you do send anything otherwise we may not be aware of any mistake <\s>
<s> i am glad the houbraken will be acceptable and will send it any way you shall think proper though perhaps as it would only make a small parcel there might be some risk in trusting it to the waggon or mail unless it could be conveniently inquired after <\s>
<s> no news of coleridge <\s>
<s> the length of this letter is quite formidable forgive it <\s>
<s> farewell and believe me my dear sir george your truly affectionate friend w <\s>
<s> wordsworth 35 35 memoirs vol <\s>
<s> 345 54 with very important additions from the original <\s>
<s> of the inscriptions at coleorton <\s>
<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george had there been room at the end of the small avenue of lime trees for planting a spacious circle of the same trees the urn might have been placed in the centre with the inscription thus altered ye lime trees ranged around this hallowed urn shoot forth with lively power at spring's return <\s>
<s> here may some painter sit in future days some future poet meditate his lays <\s>
<s> not mindless of that distant age renowned when inspiration hovered o'er this ground the haunt of him who sang how spear and shield in civil conflict met on bosworth field and of that famous youth full soon removed from earth by mighty shakspeare's self approved <\s>
<s> fletcher's associate jonson's friend beloved <\s>
<s> the first couplet of the above as it before stood would have appeared ludicrous if the stone had remained after the tree might have been gone <\s>
<s> the couplet relating to the household virtues did not accord with the painter and the poet the former being allegorical figures the latter living men <\s>
<s> what follows i composed yesterday morning thinking there might be no impropriety in placing it so as to be visible only to a person sitting within the niche which we hollowed out of the sandstone in the winter garden <\s>
<s> i am told that this is in the present form of the niche impossible but i shall be most ready when i come to coleorton to scoop out a place for it if lady beaumont think it worth while <\s>
<s> oft is the medal faithful to its trust when temples columns towers are laid in dust and tis a common ordinance of fate that things obscure and small outlive the great <\s>
<s> these inscriptions have all one fault they are too long but i was unable to do justice to the thoughts in less room <\s>
<s> the second has brought sir john beaumont and his brother francis so lively to my mind that i recur to the plan of republishing the former's poems perhaps in connection with those of francis <\s>
<s> could any further search be made after the crown of thorns <\s>
<s> if i recollect right southey applied without effect to the numerous friends he has among the collectors <\s>
