<s> it has ever appeared to me highly favourable to the beneficial influence of the church of england upon all gradations and classes of society that the patronage of its benefices is in numerous instances attached to the estates of noble families of ancient gentry and accordingly i am gratified by the opportunity afforded me in the excursion to pourtray the character of a country clergyman of more than ordinary talents born and bred in the upper ranks of society so as to partake of their refinements and at the same time brought by his pastoral office and his love of rural life into intimate connection with the peasantry of his native district <\s>
<s> to illustrate the relation which in my mind this pastor bore to the wanderer and the resemblances between them or rather the points of community in their nature i likened one to an oak and the other to a sycamore and having here referred to this comparison i need only add i had no one individual in my mind wishing rather to embody this idea than to break in upon the simplicity of it by traits of individual character or of any peculiarity of opinion <\s>

<s> these two persons were induced afterwards to settle at rydal where they both died <\s>
<s> church and churchyard the church as already noticed is that of grasmere <\s>
<s> the interior of it has been improved lately and made warmer by underdrawing the roof and raising the floor but the rude and antique majesty of its former appearance has been impaired by painting the rafters and the oak benches with a simple rail at the back dividing them from each other have given way to seats that have more the appearance of pews <\s>
<s> it is remarkable that excepting only the pew belonging to rydal hall that to rydal mount the one to the parsonage and i believe another the men and women still continue as used to be the custom in wales to sit separate from each other <\s>
<s> is this practice as old as the reformation <\s>
<s> and when and how did it originate <\s>
<s> in the jewish synagogues and in lady huntingdon's chapels the sexes are divided in the same way <\s>
<s> in the adjoining churchyard greater changes have taken place it is now not a little crowded with tombstones and near the schoolhouse which stands in the churchyard is an ugly structure built to receive the hearse which is recently come into use <\s>
<s> it would not be worth while to allude to this building or the hearse vehicle it contains but that the latter has been the means of introducing a change much to be lamented in the mode of conducting funerals among the mountains <\s>
<s> now the coffin is lodged in the hearse at the door of the house of the deceased and the corpse is so conveyed to the churchyard gate <\s>
<s> all the solemnity which formerly attended its progress as described in this poem is put an end to <\s>
<s> so much do i regret this that i beg to be excused for giving utterance here to a wish that should it befall me to die at rydal mount my own body may be carried to grasmere church after the manner in which till lately that of every one was borne to the place of sepulchre here namely on the shoulders of neighbours no house being passed without some words of a funeral psalm being sung at the time by the attendants bearing it <\s>
<s> when i put into the mouth of the wanderer many precious rites and customs of our rural ancestry are gone or stealing from us this i hope will last for ever and what follows little did i foresee that the observance and mode of proceeding which had often affected me so much would so soon be superseded <\s>
<s> having said much of the injury done to this churchyard let me add that one is at liberty to look forward to a time when by the growth of the yew trees thriving there a solemnity will be spread over the place that will in some degree make amends for the old simple character which has already been so much encroached upon and will be still more every year <\s>
<s> i will here set down by way of memorial that my friend sir g <\s>
<s> beaumont having long ago purchased the beautiful piece of water called loughrigg tarn on the banks of which he intended to build i told him that a person in kendal who was attached to the place wished to purchase it <\s>
<s> sir george finding the possession of no use to him consented to part with it and placed the purchase money 20l at my disposal for any local use which i thought proper <\s>
<s> accordingly i resolved to plant yew trees in the churchyard and had four pretty strong large oak enclosures made in each of which was planted under my own eye and principally if not entirely by my own hand two young trees with the intention of leaving the one that throve best to stand <\s>
<s> many years after mr <\s>
<s> barber who will long be remembered in grasmere mr <\s>
<s> greenwood the chief landed proprietor and myself had four other enclosures made in the churchyard at our own expense in each of which was planted a tree taken from its neighbour and they all stand thriving admirably the fences having been removed as no longer necessary <\s>
