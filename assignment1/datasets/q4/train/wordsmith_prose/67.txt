<s> davy was with us at the time <\s>
<s> we had ascended from paterdale and i could not but admire the vigour with which scott scrambled along that horn of the mountain called striding edge <\s>
<s> our progress was necessarily slow and beguiled by scott's telling many stories and amusing anecdotes as was his custom <\s>
<s> davy would have probably been better pleased if other topics had occasionally been interspersed and some discussion entered upon at all events he did not remain with us long at the top of the mountain but left us to find our way down its steep side together into the vale of grasmere where at my cottage mrs <\s>

<s> in the printed notes there is the following farther reference to the touching quotation by scott these words were quoted to me from yarrow unvisited by sir walter scott when i visited him at abbotsford a day or two before his departure for italy and the affecting condition in which he was when he looked upon rome from the janicular mount was reported to me by a lady who had the honour of conducting him thither 298 <\s>
<s> a few short steps painful they were apart from tasso's convent haven and retired grave ll <\s>
<s> this though introduced here i did not know till it was told me at rome by miss mackenzie of seaforth a lady whose friendly attentions during my residence at rome i have gratefully acknowledged with expressions of sincere regret that she is no more <\s>
<s> told me that she had accompanied sir walter to the janicular mount and after showing him the grave of tasso in the church upon the top and a mural monument there erected to his memory they left the church and stood together on the brow of the hill overlooking the city of rome <\s>
<s> his daughter anne was with them and she naturally desirous for the sake of miss mackenzie especially to have some expression of pleasure from her father half reproached him for showing nothing of that kind either by his looks or voice <\s>
<s> how can i replied he having only one leg to stand upon and that in extreme pain <\s>

<s> over waves rough and deep line 122 <\s>
<s> we took boat near the lighthouse at the point of the right horn of the bay which makes a sort of natural port for genoa but the wind was high and the waves long and rough so that i did not feel quite recompensed by the view of the city splendid as it was for the danger apparently incurred <\s>
<s> the boatman i had only one encouraged me saying we were quite safe but i was not a little glad when we gained the shore though shelley and byron one of them at least who seemed to have courted agitation from every quarter would have probably rejoiced in such a situation <\s>
<s> more than once i believe were they both in extreme danger even on the lake of geneva <\s>
<s> every man however has his fears of some kind or other and no doubt they had theirs <\s>
<s> of all men whom i have ever known coleridge had the most of passive courage in bodily trial but no one was so easily cowed when moral firmness was required in miscellaneous conversation or in the daily intercourse of social life <\s>
<s> how lovely didst thou appear savona ll <\s>
<s> there is not a single bay along this beautiful coast that might not raise in a traveller a wish to take up his abode there each as it succeeds seems more inviting than the other but the desolated convent on the cliff in the bay of savona struck my fancy most and had i for the sake of my own health or of that of a dear friend or any other cause been desirous of a residence abroad i should have let my thoughts loose upon a scheme of turning some part of this building into a habitation provided as far as might be with english comforts <\s>
<s> there is close by it a row or avenue i forget which of tall cypresses <\s>
<s> i could not forbear saying to myself what a sweet family walk or one for lonely musings would be found under the shade <\s>
<s> but there probably the trees remain little noticed and seldom enjoyed <\s>

<s> in the printed notes there is the following on aquapendente it would be ungenerous not to advert to the religious movement that since the composition of these verses in 1837 has made itself felt more or less strongly throughout the english church a movement that takes for its first principle a devout deference to the voice of christian antiquity <\s>
