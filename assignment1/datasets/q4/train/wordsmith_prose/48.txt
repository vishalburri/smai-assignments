<s> but should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy north the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate i will adduce a passage from an english poet the divine spenser which will show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the native beauty of these scenes <\s>
<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> but should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy north the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate i will adduce a passage from an english poet the divine spenser which will show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the native beauty of these scenes <\s>
<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>
<s> beside the same a dainty place there lay planted with mirtle trees and laurels green in which the birds sang many a lovely lay of god's high praise and of their sweet loves teene as it an earthly paradise had beene in whose enclosed shadow there was pight a fair pavillion scarcely to be seen the which was all within most richly dight that greatest princes living it mote well delight <\s>
<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>

<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>

<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>

<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>
<s> beside the same a dainty place there lay planted with mirtle trees and laurels green in which the birds sang many a lovely lay of god's high praise and of their sweet loves teene as it an earthly paradise had beene in whose enclosed shadow there was pight a fair pavillion scarcely to be seen the which was all within most richly dight that greatest princes living it mote well delight <\s>
<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> one cannot but regret that parish registers so seldom contain any thing but bare names in a few of this country especially in that of lowes water i have found interesting notices of unusual natural occurrences characters of the deceased and particulars of their lives <\s>

<s> we have thus far confined our observations on this division of the subject to that part of these dales which runs up far into the mountains <\s>
<s> as we descend towards the open country we meet with halls and mansions many of which have been places of defence against the incursions of the scottish borderers and they not unfrequently retain their towers and battlements <\s>
<s> to these houses parks are sometimes attached and to their successive proprietors we chiefly owe whatever ornament is still left to the country of majestic timber <\s>
<s> through the open parts of the vales are scattered also houses of a middle rank between the pastoral cottage and the old hall residence of the knight or esquire <\s>
<s> such houses differ much from the rugged cottages before described and are generally graced with a little court or garden in front where may yet be seen specimens of those fantastic and quaint figures which our ancestors were fond of shaping out in yew tree holly or box wood <\s>

<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>

<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>

<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>

<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>

<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>

<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> but should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy north the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate i will adduce a passage from an english poet the divine spenser which will show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the native beauty of these scenes <\s>
<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>
<s> beside the same a dainty place there lay planted with mirtle trees and laurels green in which the birds sang many a lovely lay of god's high praise and of their sweet loves teene as it an earthly paradise had beene in whose enclosed shadow there was pight a fair pavillion scarcely to be seen the which was all within most richly dight that greatest princes living it mote well delight <\s>
<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>

<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>

<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>

<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>
<s> beside the same a dainty place there lay planted with mirtle trees and laurels green in which the birds sang many a lovely lay of god's high praise and of their sweet loves teene as it an earthly paradise had beene in whose enclosed shadow there was pight a fair pavillion scarcely to be seen the which was all within most richly dight that greatest princes living it mote well delight <\s>
<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> one cannot but regret that parish registers so seldom contain any thing but bare names in a few of this country especially in that of lowes water i have found interesting notices of unusual natural occurrences characters of the deceased and particulars of their lives <\s>

<s> we have thus far confined our observations on this division of the subject to that part of these dales which runs up far into the mountains <\s>
<s> as we descend towards the open country we meet with halls and mansions many of which have been places of defence against the incursions of the scottish borderers and they not unfrequently retain their towers and battlements <\s>
<s> to these houses parks are sometimes attached and to their successive proprietors we chiefly owe whatever ornament is still left to the country of majestic timber <\s>
<s> through the open parts of the vales are scattered also houses of a middle rank between the pastoral cottage and the old hall residence of the knight or esquire <\s>
<s> such houses differ much from the rugged cottages before described and are generally graced with a little court or garden in front where may yet be seen specimens of those fantastic and quaint figures which our ancestors were fond of shaping out in yew tree holly or box wood <\s>

<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> but should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy north the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate i will adduce a passage from an english poet the divine spenser which will show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the native beauty of these scenes <\s>
<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>

<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>

<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>

<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>

<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>

<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>

<s> but should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy north the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate i will adduce a passage from an english poet the divine spenser which will show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the native beauty of these scenes <\s>
<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> but should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy north the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate i will adduce a passage from an english poet the divine spenser which will show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the native beauty of these scenes <\s>
<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>
<s> beside the same a dainty place there lay planted with mirtle trees and laurels green in which the birds sang many a lovely lay of god's high praise and of their sweet loves teene as it an earthly paradise had beene in whose enclosed shadow there was pight a fair pavillion scarcely to be seen the which was all within most richly dight that greatest princes living it mote well delight <\s>
<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>

<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>

<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>

<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>
<s> beside the same a dainty place there lay planted with mirtle trees and laurels green in which the birds sang many a lovely lay of god's high praise and of their sweet loves teene as it an earthly paradise had beene in whose enclosed shadow there was pight a fair pavillion scarcely to be seen the which was all within most richly dight that greatest princes living it mote well delight <\s>
<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>

<s> one cannot but regret that parish registers so seldom contain any thing but bare names in a few of this country especially in that of lowes water i have found interesting notices of unusual natural occurrences characters of the deceased and particulars of their lives <\s>

<s> we have thus far confined our observations on this division of the subject to that part of these dales which runs up far into the mountains <\s>
<s> as we descend towards the open country we meet with halls and mansions many of which have been places of defence against the incursions of the scottish borderers and they not unfrequently retain their towers and battlements <\s>
<s> to these houses parks are sometimes attached and to their successive proprietors we chiefly owe whatever ornament is still left to the country of majestic timber <\s>
<s> through the open parts of the vales are scattered also houses of a middle rank between the pastoral cottage and the old hall residence of the knight or esquire <\s>
<s> such houses differ much from the rugged cottages before described and are generally graced with a little court or garden in front where may yet be seen specimens of those fantastic and quaint figures which our ancestors were fond of shaping out in yew tree holly or box wood <\s>

<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>
<s> the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight of the colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil <\s>
<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
<s> if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen <\s>
<s> a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape <\s>
<s> how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather stains <\s>
<s> no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture <\s>
<s> but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil <\s>
<s> the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the mason's purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough cast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at <\s>
<s> the supposed necessity of rough cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings <\s>
<s> that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons <\s>
<s> the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others <\s>
<s> but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside <\s>
<s> i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating object in no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms <\s>
<s> a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the all pervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter <\s>
<s> the edifice is scarcely larger than many of the single stones or fragments of rock which are scattered near it <\s>
<s> 58 in some places scholars were formerly taught in the church and at others the school house was a sort of anti chapel to the place of worship being under the same roof an arrangement which was abandoned as irreverent <\s>
<s> it continues however to this day in borrowdale <\s>
<s> in the parish register of that chapelry is a notice that a youth who had quitted the valley and died in one of the towns on the coast of cumberland had requested that his body should be brought and interred at the foot of the pillar by which he had been accustomed to sit while a school boy <\s>
<s> one cannot but regret that parish registers so seldom contain any thing but bare names in a few of this country especially in that of lowes water i have found interesting notices of unusual natural occurrences characters of the deceased and particulars of their lives <\s>
<s> there is no good reason why such memorials should not be frequent these short and simple annals would in future ages become precious <\s>
<s> we have thus far confined our observations on this division of the subject to that part of these dales which runs up far into the mountains <\s>
<s> as we descend towards the open country we meet with halls and mansions many of which have been places of defence against the incursions of the scottish borderers and they not unfrequently retain their towers and battlements <\s>
<s> to these houses parks are sometimes attached and to their successive proprietors we chiefly owe whatever ornament is still left to the country of majestic timber <\s>
<s> through the open parts of the vales are scattered also houses of a middle rank between the pastoral cottage and the old hall residence of the knight or esquire <\s>
<s> such houses differ much from the rugged cottages before described and are generally graced with a little court or garden in front where may yet be seen specimens of those fantastic and quaint figures which our ancestors were fond of shaping out in yew tree holly or box wood <\s>
<s> the passenger will sometimes smile at such elaborate display of petty art while the house does not deign to look upon the natural beauty or the sublimity which its situation almost unavoidably commands <\s>
<s> thus has been given a faithful description the minuteness of which the reader will pardon of the face of this country as it was and had been through centuries till within the last sixty years <\s>
<s> towards the head of these dales was found a perfect republic of shepherds and agriculturists among whom the plough of each man was confined to the maintenance of his own family or to the occasional accommodation of his neighbour 59 <\s>

<s> the chapel was the only edifice that presided over these dwellings the supreme head of this pure commonwealth the members of which existed in the midst of a powerful empire like an ideal society or an organised community whose constitution had been imposed and regulated by the mountains which protected it <\s>
<s> neither high born nobleman knight nor esquire was here but many of these humble sons of the hills had a consciousness that the land which they walked over and tilled had for more than five hundred years been possessed by men of their name and blood and venerable was the transition when a curious traveller descending from the heart of the mountains had come to some ancient manorial residence in the more open parts of the vales which through the rights attached to its proprietor connected the almost visionary mountain republic he had been contemplating with the substantial frame of society as existing in the laws and constitution of a mighty empire <\s>

<s> brown the celebrated author of the estimate of the manners and principles of the times published a letter to a friend in which the attractions of the vale of keswick were delineated with a powerful pencil and the feeling of a genuine enthusiast <\s>
<s> gray the poet followed he died soon after his forlorn and melancholy pilgrimage to the vale of keswick and the record left behind him of what he had seen and felt in this journey excited that pensive interest with which the human mind is ever disposed to listen to the farewell words of a man of genius <\s>

<s> what is here so justly said of grasmere applied almost equally to all its sister vales <\s>
<s> it was well for the undisturbed pleasure of the poet that he had no forebodings of the change which was soon to take place and it might have been hoped that these words indicating how much the charm of what was depended upon what was not would of themselves have preserved the ancient franchises of this and other kindred mountain retirements from trespass or shall i dare to say would have secured scenes so consecrated from profanation <\s>
<s> the lakes had now become celebrated visitors flocked hither from all parts of england the fancies of some were smitten so deeply that they became settlers and the islands of derwent water and winandermere as they offered the strongest temptation were the first places seized upon and were instantly defaced by the intrusion <\s>
<s> the venerable wood that had grown for centuries round the small house called st <\s>
<s> herbert's hermitage had indeed some years before been felled by its native proprietor and the whole island planted anew with scotch firs left to spindle up by each other's side a melancholy phalanx defying the power of the winds and disregarding the regret of the spectator who might otherwise have cheated himself into a belief that some of the decayed remains of those oaks the place of which was in this manner usurped had been planted by the hermit's own hand <\s>
<s> this sainted spot however suffered comparatively little injury <\s>
<s> at the bidding of an alien improver the hind's cottage upon vicar's island in the same lake with its embowering sycamores and cattle shed disappeared from the corner where they stood and right in the middle and upon the precise point of the island's highest elevation rose a tall square habitation with four sides exposed like an astronomer's observatory or a warren house reared upon an eminence for the detection of depredators or like the temple of oeolus where all the winds pay him obeisance <\s>
<s> round this novel structure but at a respectful distance platoons of firs were stationed as if to protect their commander when weather and time should somewhat have shattered his strength <\s>
<s> within the narrow limits of this island were typified also the state and strength of a kingdom and its religion as it had been and was for neither was the druidical circle uncreated nor the church of the present establishment nor the stately pier emblem of commerce and navigation nor the fort to deal out thunder upon the approaching invader <\s>
<s> the taste of a succeeding proprietor rectified the mistakes as far as was practicable and has ridded the spot of its puerilities <\s>
<s> the church after having been docked of its steeple is applied both ostensibly and really to the purpose for which the body of the pile was actually erected namely a boat house the fort is demolished and without indignation on the part of the spirits of the ancient druids who officiated at the circle upon the opposite hill the mimic arrangement of stones with its sanctum sanctorum has been swept away <\s>
<s> the present instance has been singled out extravagant as it is because unquestionably this beautiful country has in numerous other places suffered from the same spirit though not clothed exactly in the same form nor active in an equal degree <\s>
<s> it will be sufficient here to utter a regret for the changes that have been made upon the principal island at winandermere and in its neighbourhood <\s>
<s> what could be more unfortunate than the taste that suggested the paring of the shores and surrounding with an embankment this spot of ground the natural shape of which was so beautiful <\s>
<s> an artificial appearance has thus been given to the whole while infinite varieties of minute beauty have been destroyed <\s>
<s> could not the margin of this noble island be given back to nature <\s>
<s> winds and waves work with a careless and graceful hand and should they in some places carry away a portion of the soil the trifling loss would be amply compensated by the additional spirit dignity and loveliness which these agents and the other powers of nature would soon communicate to what was left behind <\s>
<s> as to the larch plantations upon the main shore they who remember the original appearance of the rocky steeps scattered over with native hollies and ash trees will be prepared to agree with what i shall have to say hereafter upon plantations 60 in general <\s>
<s> 60 these are disappearing fast under the management of the present proprietor and native wood is resuming its place <\s>
<s> but in truth no one can now travel through the more frequented tracts without being offended at almost every turn by an introduction of discordant objects disturbing that peaceful harmony of form and colour which had been through a long lapse of ages most happily preserved <\s>
<s> all gross transgressions of this kind originate doubtless in a feeling natural and honourable to the human mind viz <\s>
<s> the pleasure which it receives from distinct ideas and from the perception of order regularity and contrivance <\s>
<s> now unpractised minds receive these impressions only from objects that are divided from each other by strong lines of demarcation hence the delight with which such minds are smitten by formality and harsh contrast <\s>
<s> but i would beg of those who are eager to create the means of such gratification first carefully to study what already exists and they will find in a country so lavishly gifted by nature an abundant variety of forms marked out with a precision that will satisfy their desires <\s>
<s> moreover a new habit of pleasure will be formed opposite to this arising out of the perception of the fine gradations by which in nature one thing passes away into another and the boundaries that constitute individuality disappear in one instance only to be revived elsewhere under a more alluring form <\s>
<s> the bill of dunmallet at the foot of ulswater was once divided into different portions by avenues of fir trees with a green and almost perpendicular lane descending down the steep hill through each avenue contrast this quaint appearance with the image of the same hill overgrown with self planted wood each tree springing up in the situation best suited to its kind and with that shape which the situation constrained or suffered it to take <\s>
<s> what endless melting and playing into each other of forms and colours does the one offer to a mind at once attentive and active and how insipid and lifeless compared with it appear those parts of the former exhibition with which a child a peasant perhaps or a citizen unfamiliar with natural imagery would have been most delighted <\s>
<s> the disfigurement which this country has undergone has not however proceeded wholly from the common feelings of human nature which have been referred to as the primary sources of bad taste in rural imagery another cause must be added that has chiefly shown itself in its effect upon buildings <\s>
<s> i mean a warping of the natural mind occasioned by a consciousness that this country being an object of general admiration every new house would be looked at and commented upon either for approbation or censure <\s>
<s> hence all the deformity and ungracefulness that ever pursue the steps of constraint or affectation <\s>
<s> persons who in leicestershire or northamptonshire would probably have built a modest dwelling like those of their sensible neighbours have been turned out of their course and acting a part no wonder if having had little experience they act it ill <\s>
<s> the craving for prospect also which is immoderate particularly in new settlers has rendered it impossible that buildings whatever might have been their architecture should in most instances be ornamental to the landscape rising as they do from the summits of naked hills in staring contrast to the snugness and privacy of the ancient houses <\s>
<s> no man is to be condemned for a desire to decorate his residence and possessions feeling a disposition to applaud such an endeavour i would show how the end may be best attained <\s>
<s> the rule is simple with respect to grounds work where you can in the spirit of nature with an invisible hand of art <\s>
<s> planting and a removal of wood may thus and thus only be carried on with good effect and the like may be said of building if antiquity who may be styled the co partner and sister of nature be not denied the respect to which she is entitled <\s>
<s> i have already spoken of the beautiful forms of the ancient mansions of this country and of the happy manner in which they harmonise with the forms of nature <\s>
<s> why cannot such be taken as a model and modern internal convenience be confined within their external grace and dignity <\s>
<s> expense to be avoided or difficulties to be overcome may prevent a close adherence to this model still however it might be followed to a certain degree in the style of architecture and in the choice of situation if the thirst for prospect were mitigated by those considerations of comfort shelter and convenience which used to be chiefly sought after <\s>
<s> but should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy north the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate i will adduce a passage from an english poet the divine spenser which will show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the native beauty of these scenes <\s>
<s> into that forest farre they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading itself into a spacious plaine and in the midst a little river plaide emongst the puny stones which seem'd to plaine with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine <\s>
<s> beside the same a dainty place there lay planted with mirtle trees and laurels green in which the birds sang many a lovely lay of god's high praise and of their sweet loves teene as it an earthly paradise had beene in whose enclosed shadow there was pight a fair pavillion scarcely to be seen the which was all within most richly dight that greatest princes living it mote well delight <\s>
<s> houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident <\s>
<s> mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable <\s>
<s> far winding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place <\s>
<s> a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view <\s>
<s> it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquity a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed away as a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay <\s>
<s> child of loud throated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age <\s>
<s> to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature <\s>
<s> but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentleman's mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside <\s>
<s> now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement <\s>
<s> the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz <\s>
<s> that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature should also determine its colour <\s>
<s> sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice <\s>
<s> of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally <\s>
<s> for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance <\s>

<s> the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction <\s>
<s> nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed <\s>
<s> for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an over prevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract <\s>
