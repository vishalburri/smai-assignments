<s> she had sensibility sufficient for the tender parts of dramatic writing but in the stormy and tumultuous she would probably have failed altogether <\s>
<s> she seems to have made it a moral and religious duty to control her feelings lest they should mislead her <\s>

<s> by the by in the next page are two impassioned lines spoken to a person fainting then let me hug and press thee into life and lend thee motion from my beating heart <\s>
<s> from the style and versification of this so much her longest work i conjecture that lady winchelsea had but a slender acquaintance with the drama of the earlier part of the preceding century <\s>
<s> yet her style in rhyme is often admirable chaste tender and vigorous and entirely free from sparkle antithesis and that overculture which reminds one by its broad glare its stiffness and heaviness of the double daisies of the garden compared with their modest and sensitive kindred of the fields <\s>
<s> perhaps i am mistaken but i think there is a good deal of resemblance in her style and versification to that of tickell to whom dr <\s>

<s> she had sensibility sufficient for the tender parts of dramatic writing but in the stormy and tumultuous she would probably have failed altogether <\s>
<s> she seems to have made it a moral and religious duty to control her feelings lest they should mislead her <\s>

<s> by the by in the next page are two impassioned lines spoken to a person fainting then let me hug and press thee into life and lend thee motion from my beating heart <\s>
<s> from the style and versification of this so much her longest work i conjecture that lady winchelsea had but a slender acquaintance with the drama of the earlier part of the preceding century <\s>
<s> yet her style in rhyme is often admirable chaste tender and vigorous and entirely free from sparkle antithesis and that overculture which reminds one by its broad glare its stiffness and heaviness of the double daisies of the garden compared with their modest and sensitive kindred of the fields <\s>
<s> perhaps i am mistaken but i think there is a good deal of resemblance in her style and versification to that of tickell to whom dr <\s>

<s> she had sensibility sufficient for the tender parts of dramatic writing but in the stormy and tumultuous she would probably have failed altogether <\s>
<s> she seems to have made it a moral and religious duty to control her feelings lest they should mislead her <\s>

<s> by the by in the next page are two impassioned lines spoken to a person fainting then let me hug and press thee into life and lend thee motion from my beating heart <\s>
<s> from the style and versification of this so much her longest work i conjecture that lady winchelsea had but a slender acquaintance with the drama of the earlier part of the preceding century <\s>
<s> yet her style in rhyme is often admirable chaste tender and vigorous and entirely free from sparkle antithesis and that overculture which reminds one by its broad glare its stiffness and heaviness of the double daisies of the garden compared with their modest and sensitive kindred of the fields <\s>
<s> perhaps i am mistaken but i think there is a good deal of resemblance in her style and versification to that of tickell to whom dr <\s>

<s> she had sensibility sufficient for the tender parts of dramatic writing but in the stormy and tumultuous she would probably have failed altogether <\s>
<s> she seems to have made it a moral and religious duty to control her feelings lest they should mislead her <\s>

<s> by the by in the next page are two impassioned lines spoken to a person fainting then let me hug and press thee into life and lend thee motion from my beating heart <\s>
<s> from the style and versification of this so much her longest work i conjecture that lady winchelsea had but a slender acquaintance with the drama of the earlier part of the preceding century <\s>
<s> yet her style in rhyme is often admirable chaste tender and vigorous and entirely free from sparkle antithesis and that overculture which reminds one by its broad glare its stiffness and heaviness of the double daisies of the garden compared with their modest and sensitive kindred of the fields <\s>
<s> perhaps i am mistaken but i think there is a good deal of resemblance in her style and versification to that of tickell to whom dr <\s>

<s> i observed that lady winchelsea was unfortunate in her models pindarics and fables nor does it appear from her aristomenes that she would have been more successful than her contemporaries if she had cultivated tragedy <\s>
<s> she had sensibility sufficient for the tender parts of dramatic writing but in the stormy and tumultuous she would probably have failed altogether <\s>
<s> she seems to have made it a moral and religious duty to control her feelings lest they should mislead her <\s>
<s> of love as a passion she is afraid no doubt from a conscious inability to soften it down into friendship <\s>
<s> i have often applied two lines of her drama p <\s>

<s> by the by in the next page are two impassioned lines spoken to a person fainting then let me hug and press thee into life and lend thee motion from my beating heart <\s>
<s> from the style and versification of this so much her longest work i conjecture that lady winchelsea had but a slender acquaintance with the drama of the earlier part of the preceding century <\s>
<s> yet her style in rhyme is often admirable chaste tender and vigorous and entirely free from sparkle antithesis and that overculture which reminds one by its broad glare its stiffness and heaviness of the double daisies of the garden compared with their modest and sensitive kindred of the fields <\s>
<s> perhaps i am mistaken but i think there is a good deal of resemblance in her style and versification to that of tickell to whom dr <\s>
<s> johnson justly assigns a high place among the minor poets and of whom goldsmith rightly observes that there is a strain of ballad thinking through all his poetry and it is very attractive <\s>
