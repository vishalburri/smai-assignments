<s> it was well that you did not forward my little poem to the party he entertaining the opinions he holds and being of the character you describe <\s>
<s> i shall therefore be gratified if you as you propose write him a note expressing that i have nothing among my mss <\s>
<s> that would suit his purpose <\s>
<s> the verses are already printed in the new edition of my poems double column which is going through the press <\s>
<s> it will contain about 300 verses not found in the previous edition <\s>
<s> i do not remember whether i have mentioned to you that following your example i have greatly extended the class entitled poems of the imagination thinking as you must have done that if imagination were predominant in the class it was not indispensable that it should pervade every poem which it contained <\s>
<s> limiting the class as i had done before seemed to imply and to the uncandid or unobserving it did so that the faculty which is the primum mobile in poetry had little to do in the estimation of the author with the pieces not arranged under that head <\s>
<s> i therefore feel much obliged to you for suggesting by your practice the plan which i have adopted <\s>
<s> in respect to the prefaces my own wish would be that now the poems should be left to speak for themselves without them but i know that this would not answer for the purposes of sale <\s>
<s> they will therefore be printed at the end of the volume and to this i am in some degree reconciled by the matter they contain relating to poetry in general and the principles they inculcate <\s>
<s> i hope that upon the whole the edition will please you <\s>
<s> in a very few instances i have altered the expression for the worse on account of the same feeling or word occurring rather too near the passage <\s>
<s> for example the sonnet on baptism begins blest be the church <\s>
<s> but unfortunately the word occurs some three or four lines just before or after i have therefore though reluctantly substituted the less impressive word dear be the church <\s>
<s> i mention this solely to prevent blame on your part in this and a few similar cases where an injurious change has been made <\s>
<s> the book will be off my hands i hope in about two weeks <\s>
<s> wordsworth and i left home four days ago and do not intend to return if all goes well in less than five or six weeks from this time <\s>
<s> we purpose in our way home to visit york the cathedral of which city has been restored and then we shall go to leeds on a visit to our friend mr <\s>
<s> james marshall in full expectation that we shall be highly delighted by the humane and judicious manner in which his manufactory is managed and by inspecting the schools which he and his brother have established and superintended <\s>
<s> we also promise ourselves much pleasure from the sight of the magnificent church which upon the foundation of the old parish church of that town has been built through the exertions and by the munificence of the present incumbent that excellent and able man dr <\s>

<s> this letter is written by the side of my brother in law who eight years ago became a cripple confined to his chair by the accident of his horse falling with him in the high road where he lay without power to move either hand or leg but left in perfect possession of his faculties <\s>
<s> his bodily sufferings are by this time somewhat abated but they still continue severe <\s>
<s> his patience and cheerfulness are so admirable that i could not forbear mentioning him to you <\s>
<s> he is an example to us all and most undeserving should we be if we did not profit by it <\s>
<s> his family have lately succeeded in persuading him to have his portrait taken as he sits in his arm chair <\s>
<s> it is an excellent likeness one of the best i ever saw and will be invaluable to his family <\s>
<s> this reminds me of mr <\s>
<s> inman and a promise which he made that he would send us a copy of your portrait of myself <\s>
<s> i say a promise though it scarcely amounted to that absolutely but it was little short of it <\s>
<s> do you think he could find time to act upon his own wish in this matter <\s>
<s> the people young and old were all making it holiday and the queen could not but be affected with these universal manifestations of affectionate loyalty <\s>
<s> as i have said we were detained two hours and i much regret that it did not strike me at the moment to throw off my feelings in verse for i had ample time to have done so and might perhaps have contrived to present through some of the authorities the tribute to my royal mistress <\s>
<s> how must these words shock your republican ears <\s>
<s> but you are too well acquainted with mankind and their history not to be aware that love of country can clothe itself in many shapes <\s>
<s> i need not say what pleasure it would give us to see you and mrs <\s>
<s> reed in our beautiful place of abode <\s>
<s> i have no wish to see the review of my poems to which you allude nor should i read it if it fell in my way <\s>
<s> it is too late in life for me to profit by censure and i am indifferent to praise merely as such <\s>

<s> reed i have as usual been long in your debt which i am pretty sure you will excuse as heretofore <\s>
<s> it gave me much pleasure to have a glimpse of your brother under circumstances which no doubt he will have described to you <\s>
<s> he spoke of his health as improved and i hope it will continue to do so <\s>
<s> i understood from him that it was probable he should call at rydal before his return to his own country <\s>
<s> i need not say to you i shall be glad truly glad to see him both for his own sake and as so nearly connected with you <\s>
<s> my absence from home lately was not of more than three weeks <\s>
<s> i took the journey to london solely to pay my respects to the queen upon my appointment to the laureateship upon the decease of my friend mr <\s>
<s> the weather was very cold and i caught an inflammation in one of my eyes which rendered my stay in the south very uncomfortable <\s>
<s> i nevertheless did in respect to the object of my journey all that was required <\s>
<s> the reception given me by the queen at her ball was most gracious <\s>
<s> everett the wife of your minister among many others was a witness to it without knowing who i was <\s>
<s> it moved her to the shedding of tears <\s>
<s> this effect was in part produced i suppose by american habits of feeling as pertaining to a republican government <\s>
<s> to see a grey haired man of seventy five years of age kneeling down in a large assembly to kiss the hand of a young woman is a sight for which institutions essentially democratic do not prepare a spectator of either sex and must naturally place the opinions upon which a republic is founded and the sentiments which support it in strong contrast with a government based and upheld as ours is <\s>
<s> i am not therefore surprised that mrs <\s>
<s> everett was moved as she herself described to persons of my acquaintance among others to mr <\s>
<s> by the by of this gentleman now i believe in his eighty third year i saw more than of any other person except my host mr <\s>
<s> moxon while i was in london <\s>
<s> he is singularly fresh and strong for his years and his mental faculties with the exception of his memory a little not at all impaired <\s>
<s> it is remarkable that he and the rev <\s>

<s> since they became known burns cowper mason the author of caractacus and friend of gray have died <\s>
<s> thomas warton laureate then byron shelley keats and a good deal later 208 scott coleridge crabbe southey lamb the ettrick shepherd cary the translator of dante crowe the author of lewesdon hill and others of more or less distinction have disappeared <\s>

<s> i saw tennyson when i was in london several times <\s>
<s> he is decidedly the first of our living poets and i hope will live to give the world still better things <\s>
<s> you will be pleased to hear that he expressed in the strongest terms his gratitude to my writings <\s>
<s> to this i was far from indifferent though persuaded that he is not much in sympathy with what i should myself most value in my attempts viz <\s>
<s> the spirituality with which i have endeavoured to invest the material universe and the moral relations under which i have wished to exhibit its most ordinary appearances <\s>
<s> i ought not to conclude this first portion of my letter without telling you that i have now under my roof a cousin who some time ago was introduced improperly i think she being then a child to the notice of the public as one of the english poetesses in an article of the quarterly so entitled <\s>
<s> her name is emmeline fisher and her mother is my first cousin <\s>
<s> what advances she may have made in latter years i do not know but her productions from the age of eight to twelve were not less than astonishing <\s>
<s> she only arrived yesterday and we promise ourselves much pleasure in seeing more of her <\s>
<s> our dear friend miss fenwick is also under our roof so is katharine southey her late father's youngest daughter so that we reckon ourselves rich though our only daughter is far from us being gone to oporto with her husband on account of her enfeebled frame and most unfortunately soon after her arrival she was seized with a violent attack of rheumatic fever caused by exposure to the evening air <\s>
<s> we have also been obliged lately to part with four grandsons very fine boys who are gone with their father to italy to visit their mother kept there by severe illness which sent her abroad two years ago <\s>
<s> under these circumstances we old people keep our spirits as well as we can trusting the end to god's goodness <\s>
<s> now for the enclosed poem 209 which i wrote the other day and which i send to you hoping it may give you some pleasure as a scanty repayment for all that we owe you <\s>
<s> our dear friend miss fenwick is especially desirous that her warmest thanks should be returned to you for all the trouble you have taken about her bonds <\s>
<s> but to return to the verses if you approve pray forward them with my compliments and thanks for his letter to <\s>
<s> in his letter he states that with others he is strenuously exerting himself in endeavours to abolish slavery and as one of the means of disposing the public mind to that measure he is about to publish selections from various authors in behalf of humanity <\s>
<s> he begs an original composition from me <\s>
<s> i have nothing bearing directly upon slavery but if you think this little piece would serve his cause indirectly pray be so kind as to forward it to him <\s>
<s> he speaks of himself as deeply indebted to my writings <\s>
<s> 209 the poem enclosed is the westmoreland girl dated june 6 1845 <\s>
<s> the text corresponds with that in the one volume edition with the exception of the two stanzas added in the next letter and in the 1st stanza thoughtless has been substituted for simple and in the 18th is laid for must lie <\s>

<s> reed the sight of your letter was very welcome and its contents proved most agreeable <\s>
<s> it was well that you did not forward my little poem to the party he entertaining the opinions he holds and being of the character you describe <\s>
<s> i shall therefore be gratified if you as you propose write him a note expressing that i have nothing among my mss <\s>
<s> that would suit his purpose <\s>
<s> the verses are already printed in the new edition of my poems double column which is going through the press <\s>
<s> it will contain about 300 verses not found in the previous edition <\s>
<s> i do not remember whether i have mentioned to you that following your example i have greatly extended the class entitled poems of the imagination thinking as you must have done that if imagination were predominant in the class it was not indispensable that it should pervade every poem which it contained <\s>
<s> limiting the class as i had done before seemed to imply and to the uncandid or unobserving it did so that the faculty which is the primum mobile in poetry had little to do in the estimation of the author with the pieces not arranged under that head <\s>
<s> i therefore feel much obliged to you for suggesting by your practice the plan which i have adopted <\s>
<s> in respect to the prefaces my own wish would be that now the poems should be left to speak for themselves without them but i know that this would not answer for the purposes of sale <\s>
<s> they will therefore be printed at the end of the volume and to this i am in some degree reconciled by the matter they contain relating to poetry in general and the principles they inculcate <\s>
<s> i hope that upon the whole the edition will please you <\s>
<s> in a very few instances i have altered the expression for the worse on account of the same feeling or word occurring rather too near the passage <\s>
<s> for example the sonnet on baptism begins blest be the church <\s>
<s> but unfortunately the word occurs some three or four lines just before or after i have therefore though reluctantly substituted the less impressive word dear be the church <\s>
<s> i mention this solely to prevent blame on your part in this and a few similar cases where an injurious change has been made <\s>
<s> the book will be off my hands i hope in about two weeks <\s>
<s> wordsworth and i left home four days ago and do not intend to return if all goes well in less than five or six weeks from this time <\s>

<s> this letter is written by the side of my brother in law who eight years ago became a cripple confined to his chair by the accident of his horse falling with him in the high road where he lay without power to move either hand or leg but left in perfect possession of his faculties <\s>
<s> his bodily sufferings are by this time somewhat abated but they still continue severe <\s>
<s> his patience and cheerfulness are so admirable that i could not forbear mentioning him to you <\s>
<s> he is an example to us all and most undeserving should we be if we did not profit by it <\s>
<s> his family have lately succeeded in persuading him to have his portrait taken as he sits in his arm chair <\s>
<s> it is an excellent likeness one of the best i ever saw and will be invaluable to his family <\s>
<s> this reminds me of mr <\s>
<s> inman and a promise which he made that he would send us a copy of your portrait of myself <\s>
<s> i say a promise though it scarcely amounted to that absolutely but it was little short of it <\s>
<s> do you think he could find time to act upon his own wish in this matter <\s>
<s> the people young and old were all making it holiday and the queen could not but be affected with these universal manifestations of affectionate loyalty <\s>
<s> as i have said we were detained two hours and i much regret that it did not strike me at the moment to throw off my feelings in verse for i had ample time to have done so and might perhaps have contrived to present through some of the authorities the tribute to my royal mistress <\s>
<s> how must these words shock your republican ears <\s>
<s> but you are too well acquainted with mankind and their history not to be aware that love of country can clothe itself in many shapes <\s>
<s> i need not say what pleasure it would give us to see you and mrs <\s>
<s> reed in our beautiful place of abode <\s>
<s> i have no wish to see the review of my poems to which you allude nor should i read it if it fell in my way <\s>
<s> it is too late in life for me to profit by censure and i am indifferent to praise merely as such <\s>

<s> the people young and old were all making it holiday and the queen could not but be affected with these universal manifestations of affectionate loyalty <\s>
<s> as i have said we were detained two hours and i much regret that it did not strike me at the moment to throw off my feelings in verse for i had ample time to have done so and might perhaps have contrived to present through some of the authorities the tribute to my royal mistress <\s>
<s> how must these words shock your republican ears <\s>
<s> but you are too well acquainted with mankind and their history not to be aware that love of country can clothe itself in many shapes <\s>
<s> i need not say what pleasure it would give us to see you and mrs <\s>

<s> i have no wish to see the review of my poems to which you allude nor should i read it if it fell in my way <\s>

<s> reed i have as usual been long in your debt which i am pretty sure you will excuse as heretofore <\s>
<s> it gave me much pleasure to have a glimpse of your brother under circumstances which no doubt he will have described to you <\s>
<s> he spoke of his health as improved and i hope it will continue to do so <\s>
<s> i understood from him that it was probable he should call at rydal before his return to his own country <\s>
<s> i need not say to you i shall be glad truly glad to see him both for his own sake and as so nearly connected with you <\s>
<s> my absence from home lately was not of more than three weeks <\s>
<s> i took the journey to london solely to pay my respects to the queen upon my appointment to the laureateship upon the decease of my friend mr <\s>
<s> the weather was very cold and i caught an inflammation in one of my eyes which rendered my stay in the south very uncomfortable <\s>
<s> i nevertheless did in respect to the object of my journey all that was required <\s>
<s> the reception given me by the queen at her ball was most gracious <\s>
<s> everett the wife of your minister among many others was a witness to it without knowing who i was <\s>
<s> it moved her to the shedding of tears <\s>
<s> this effect was in part produced i suppose by american habits of feeling as pertaining to a republican government <\s>
<s> to see a grey haired man of seventy five years of age kneeling down in a large assembly to kiss the hand of a young woman is a sight for which institutions essentially democratic do not prepare a spectator of either sex and must naturally place the opinions upon which a republic is founded and the sentiments which support it in strong contrast with a government based and upheld as ours is <\s>
<s> i am not therefore surprised that mrs <\s>
<s> everett was moved as she herself described to persons of my acquaintance among others to mr <\s>
<s> by the by of this gentleman now i believe in his eighty third year i saw more than of any other person except my host mr <\s>
<s> moxon while i was in london <\s>
<s> he is singularly fresh and strong for his years and his mental faculties with the exception of his memory a little not at all impaired <\s>

<s> he is decidedly the first of our living poets and i hope will live to give the world still better things <\s>
<s> you will be pleased to hear that he expressed in the strongest terms his gratitude to my writings <\s>
<s> to this i was far from indifferent though persuaded that he is not much in sympathy with what i should myself most value in my attempts viz <\s>
<s> the spirituality with which i have endeavoured to invest the material universe and the moral relations under which i have wished to exhibit its most ordinary appearances <\s>
<s> i ought not to conclude this first portion of my letter without telling you that i have now under my roof a cousin who some time ago was introduced improperly i think she being then a child to the notice of the public as one of the english poetesses in an article of the quarterly so entitled <\s>

<s> what advances she may have made in latter years i do not know but her productions from the age of eight to twelve were not less than astonishing <\s>

<s> our dear friend miss fenwick is also under our roof so is katharine southey her late father's youngest daughter so that we reckon ourselves rich though our only daughter is far from us being gone to oporto with her husband on account of her enfeebled frame and most unfortunately soon after her arrival she was seized with a violent attack of rheumatic fever caused by exposure to the evening air <\s>
<s> we have also been obliged lately to part with four grandsons very fine boys who are gone with their father to italy to visit their mother kept there by severe illness which sent her abroad two years ago <\s>
<s> under these circumstances we old people keep our spirits as well as we can trusting the end to god's goodness <\s>
<s> now for the enclosed poem 209 which i wrote the other day and which i send to you hoping it may give you some pleasure as a scanty repayment for all that we owe you <\s>
<s> our dear friend miss fenwick is especially desirous that her warmest thanks should be returned to you for all the trouble you have taken about her bonds <\s>

<s> in his letter he states that with others he is strenuously exerting himself in endeavours to abolish slavery and as one of the means of disposing the public mind to that measure he is about to publish selections from various authors in behalf of humanity <\s>
<s> he begs an original composition from me <\s>
<s> i have nothing bearing directly upon slavery but if you think this little piece would serve his cause indirectly pray be so kind as to forward it to him <\s>
