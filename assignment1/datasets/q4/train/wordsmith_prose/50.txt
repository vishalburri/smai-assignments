<s> we sat down to our repast and gladly would we have tempered our beverage for there was no spring or well near us with such a supply of delicious water as we might have procured had we been on the rival summit of great gavel for on its highest point is a small triangular receptacle in the native rock which the shepherds say is never dry <\s>

<s> we had attained the object of this journey but our ambition now mounted higher <\s>
<s> we saw the summit of scawfell apparently very near to us and we shaped our course towards it but discovering that it could not be reached without first making a considerable descent we resolved instead to aim at another point of the same mountain called the pikes which i have since found has been estimated as higher than the summit bearing the name of scawfell head where the stone man is built <\s>
<s> the sun had never once been overshadowed by a cloud during the whole of our progress from the centre of borrowdale <\s>
<s> on the summit of the pike which we gained after much toil though without difficulty there was not a breath of air to stir even the papers containing our refreshment as they lay spread out upon a rock <\s>
<s> the stillness seemed to be not of this world we paused and kept silence to listen and no sound could be heard the scawfell cataracts were voiceless to us and there was not an insect to hum in the air <\s>

<s> but the majesty of the mountains below and close to us is not to be conceived <\s>
<s> we now beheld the whole mass of great gavel from its base the den of wastdale at our feet a gulf immeasurable grasmire and the other mountains of crummock ennerdale and its mountains and the sea beyond <\s>
<s> we sat down to our repast and gladly would we have tempered our beverage for there was no spring or well near us with such a supply of delicious water as we might have procured had we been on the rival summit of great gavel for on its highest point is a small triangular receptacle in the native rock which the shepherds say is never dry <\s>
<s> there we might have slaked our thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial liquid for the cup or basin it appears has no other feeder than the dews of heaven the showers the vapours the hoar frost and the spotless snow <\s>

<s> the vales which we had seen from ash course lay yet in view and side by side with eskdale we now saw the sister vale of donnerdale terminated by the duddon sands <\s>
<s> but the majesty of the mountains below and close to us is not to be conceived <\s>
<s> we now beheld the whole mass of great gavel from its base the den of wastdale at our feet a gulf immeasurable grasmire and the other mountains of crummock ennerdale and its mountains and the sea beyond <\s>
<s> we sat down to our repast and gladly would we have tempered our beverage for there was no spring or well near us with such a supply of delicious water as we might have procured had we been on the rival summit of great gavel for on its highest point is a small triangular receptacle in the native rock which the shepherds say is never dry <\s>
<s> there we might have slaked our thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial liquid for the cup or basin it appears has no other feeder than the dews of heaven the showers the vapours the hoar frost and the spotless snow <\s>
<s> while we were gazing around look i exclaimed at yon ship upon the glittering sea <\s>
<s> is it a ship <\s>
<s> it can be nothing else interposed my companion i cannot be mistaken i am so accustomed to the appearance of ships at sea <\s>
<s> the guide dropped the argument but before a minute was gone he quietly said now look at your ship it is changed into a horse <\s>
<s> so indeed it was a horse with a gallant neck and head <\s>
<s> we laughed heartily and i hope when again inclined to be positive i may remember the ship and the horse upon the glittering sea and the calm confidence yet submissiveness of our wise man of the mountains who certainly had more knowledge of clouds than we whatever might be our knowledge of ships <\s>
<s> i know not how long we might have remained on the summit of the pike without a thought of moving had not our guide warned us that we must not linger for a storm was coming <\s>
<s> we looked in vain to espy the signs of it <\s>
<s> mountains vales and sea were touched with the clear light of the sun <\s>
<s> it is there said he pointing to the sea beyond whitehaven and there we perceived a light vapour unnoticeable but by a shepherd accustomed to watch all mountain bodings <\s>
<s> we gazed around again and yet again unwilling to lose the remembrance of what lay before us in that lofty solitude and then prepared to depart <\s>
<s> meanwhile the air changed to cold and we saw that tiny vapour swelled into mighty masses of cloud which came boiling over the mountains <\s>
<s> great gavel helvellyn and skiddaw were wrapped in storm yet langdale and the mountains in that quarter remained all bright in sunshine <\s>
<s> soon the storm reached us we sheltered under a crag and almost as rapidly as it had come it passed away and left us free to observe the struggles of gloom and sunshine in other quarters <\s>
<s> langdale now had its share and the pikes of langdale were decorated by two splendid rainbows <\s>
<s> skiddaw also had his own rainbows <\s>
<s> before we again reached ash course every cloud had vanished from every summit <\s>
<s> i ought to have mentioned that round the top of scawfell pike not a blade of grass is to be seen <\s>
<s> cushions or tufts of moss parched and brown appear between the huge blocks and stones that lie in heaps on all sides to a great distance like skeletons or bones of the earth not needed at the creation and there left to be covered with never dying lichens which the clouds and dews nourish and adorn with colours of vivid and exquisite beauty <\s>
<s> flowers the most brilliant feathers and even gems scarcely surpass in colouring some of those masses of stone which no human eye beholds except the shepherd or traveller be led thither by curiosity and how seldom must this happen <\s>
<s> for the other eminence is the one visited by the adventurous stranger and the shepherd has no inducement to ascend the pike in quest of his sheep no food being there to tempt them <\s>
<s> we certainly were singularly favoured in the weather for when we were seated on the summit our conductor turning his eyes thoughtfully round said i do not know that in my whole life i was ever at any season of the year so high upon the mountains on so calm a day <\s>
<s> it was the 7th of october afterwards we had a spectacle of the grandeur of earth and heaven commingled yet without terror <\s>
<s> we knew that the storm would pass away for so our prophetic guide had assured us <\s>
<s> before we reached seathwaite in borrowdale a few stars had appeared and we pursued our way down the vale to rosthwaite by moonlight <\s>
<s> scawfell and helvellyn being the two mountains of this region which will best repay the fatigue of ascending them the following verses may be here introduced with propriety <\s>
<s> they are from the author's miscellaneous poems <\s>
<s> on her first ascent to the summit of helvellyn <\s>
<s> inmate of a mountain dwelling thou hast clomb aloft and gazed from the watch towers of helvellyn awed delighted and amazed <\s>
<s> potent was the spell that bound thee not unwilling to obey for blue ether's arms flung round thee stilled the pantings of dismay <\s>
<s> the dwindled woods and meadows <\s>
<s> what a vast abyss is there <\s>
<s> the clouds the solemn shadows and the glistenings heavenly fair <\s>
<s> and a record of commotion which a thousand ridges yield ridge and gulf and distant ocean gleaming like a silver shield <\s>
<s> take thy flight possess inherit alps or andes they are thine <\s>
<s> with the morning's roseate spirit sweep their length of snowy line or survey the bright dominions in the gorgeous colours drest flung from off the purple pinions evening spreads throughout the west <\s>
<s> thine are all the coral fountains warbling in each sparry vault of the untrodden lunar mountains listen to their songs or halt to niphate's top invited whither spiteful satan steered or descend where the ark alighted when the green earth re appeared for the power of hills is on thee as was witnessed through thine eye then when old helvellyn won thee to confess their majesty <\s>
<s> having said so much of points of view to which few are likely to ascend i am induced to subjoin an account of a short excursion through more accessible parts of the country made at a time when it is seldom seen but by the inhabitants <\s>
<s> as the journal was written for one acquainted with the general features of the country only those effects and appearances are dwelt upon which are produced by the changeableness of the atmosphere or belong to the season when the excursion was made <\s>
<s> 1805 on the 7th of november on a damp and gloomy morning we left grasmere vale intending to pass a few days on the banks of ullswater <\s>
<s> a mild and dry autumn had been unusually favourable to the preservation and beauty of foliage and far advanced as the season was the trees on the larger island of rydal mere retained a splendour which did not need the heightening of sunshine <\s>
<s> we noticed as we passed that the line of the grey rocky shore of that island shaggy with variegated bushes and shrubs and spotted and striped with purplish brown heath indistinguishably blending with its image reflected in the still water produced a curious resemblance both in form and colour to a richly coated caterpillar as it might appear through a magnifying glass of extraordinary power <\s>
<s> the mists gathered as we went along but when we reached the top of kirkstone we were glad we had not been discouraged by the apprehension of bad weather <\s>
<s> though not able to see a hundred yards before us we were more than contented <\s>
<s> at such a time and in such a place every scattered stone the size of one's head becomes a companion <\s>
<s> near the top of the pass is the remnant of an old wall which magnified though obscured by the vapour might have been taken for a fragment of some monument of ancient grandeur yet that same pile of stones we had never before even observed <\s>
<s> this situation it must be allowed is not favourable to gaiety but a pleasing hurry of spirits accompanies the surprise occasioned by objects transformed dilated or distorted as they are when seen through such a medium <\s>
<s> many of the fragments of rock on the top and slopes of kirkstone and of similar places are fantastic enough in themselves but the full effect of such impressions can only be had in a state of weather when they are not likely to be sought for <\s>
<s> it was not till we had descended considerably that the fields of hartshope were seen like a lake tinged by the reflection of sunny clouds i mistook them for brotherswater but soon after we saw that lake gleaming faintly with a steelly brightness then as we continued to descend appeared the brown oaks and the birches of lively yellow and the cottages and the lowly hall of hartshope with its long roof and ancient chimneys <\s>
<s> during great part of our way to patterdale we had rain or rather drizzling vapour for there was never a drop upon our hair or clothes larger than the smallest pearls upon a lady's ring <\s>
<s> the following morning incessant rain till 11 o'clock when the sky began to clear and we walked along the eastern shore of ullswater towards the farm of blowick <\s>
<s> the wind blew strong and drove the clouds forward on the side of the mountain above our heads two storm stiffened black yew trees fixed our notice seen through or under the edge of the flying mists four or five goats were bounding among the rocks the sheep moved about more quietly or cowered beneath their sheltering places <\s>
<s> this is the only part of the country where goats are now found ;[ 66 but this morning before we had seen these i was reminded of that picturesque animal by two rams of mountain breed both with ammonian horns and with beards majestic as that which michael angelo has given to his statue of moses but to return when our path had brought us to that part of the naked common which overlooks the woods and bush besprinkled fields of blowick the lake clouds and mists were all in motion to the sound of sweeping winds the church and cottages of patterdale scarcely visible or seen only by fits between the shifting vapours <\s>
<s> to the northward the scene was less visionary place fell steady and bold the whole lake driving onward like a great river waves dancing round the small islands <\s>
<s> the house at blowick was the boundary of our walk and we returned lamenting to see a decaying and uncomfortable dwelling in a place where sublimity and beauty seemed to contend with each other <\s>
<s> but these regrets were dispelled by a glance on the woods that clothe the opposite steeps of the lake <\s>
<s> how exquisite was the mixture of sober and splendid hues <\s>
<s> the general colouring of the trees was brown rather that of ripe hazel nuts but towards the water there were yet beds of green and in the highest parts of the wood was abundance of yellow foliage which gleaming through a vapoury lustre reminded us of masses of clouds as you see them gathered together in the west and touched with the golden light of the setting sun <\s>
<s> these also have disappeared <\s>
<s> after dinner we walked up the vale i had never had an idea of its extent and width in passing along the public road on the other side <\s>
<s> we followed the path that leads from house to house two or three times it took us through some of those copses or groves that cover the little hillocks in the middle of the vale making an intricate and pleasing intermixture of lawn and wood <\s>
<s> our fancies could not resist the temptation and we fixed upon a spot for a cottage which we began to build and finished as easily as castles are raised in the air visited the same spot in the evening <\s>
<s> i shall say nothing of the moonlight aspect of the situation which had charmed us so much in the afternoon but i wish you had been with us when in returning to our friend's house we espied his lady's large white dog lying in the moonshine upon the round knoll under the old yew tree in the garden a romantic image the dark tree and its dark shadow and the elegant creature as fair as a spirit <\s>
<s> the torrents murmured softly the mountains down which they were falling did not to my sight furnish a back ground for this ossianic picture but i had a consciousness of the depth of the seclusion and that mountains were embracing us on all sides i saw not but i felt that they were there <\s>
<s> friday november 9th rain as yesterday till 10 o'clock when we took a boat to row down the lake <\s>
<s> the day improved clouds and sunny gleams on the mountains <\s>
<s> in the large bay under place fell three fishermen were dragging a net picturesque group beneath the high and bare crags <\s>
<s> a raven was seen aloft not hovering like the kite for that is not the habit of the bird but passing on with a straight forward perseverance and timing the motion of its wings to its own croaking <\s>
<s> the waters were agitated and the iron tone of the raven's voice which strikes upon the ear at all times as the more dolorous from its regularity was in fine keeping with the wild scene before our eyes <\s>
<s> this carnivorous fowl is a great enemy to the lambs of these solitudes i recollect frequently seeing when a boy bunches of unfledged ravens suspended from the church yard gates of h for which a reward of so much a head was given to the adventurous destroyer the fishermen drew their net ashore and hundreds of fish were leaping in their prison <\s>
<s> they were all of the kind called skellies a sort of fresh water herring shoals of which may sometimes be seen dimpling or rippling the surface of the lake in calm weather <\s>
<s> this species is not found i believe in any other of these lakes nor as far as i know is the chevin that spiritless fish though i am loth to call it so for it was a prime favourite with isaac walton which must frequent ullswater as i have seen a large shoal passing into the lake from the river eamont <\s>
<s> here are no pike and the char are smaller than those of the other lakes and of inferior quality but the grey trout attains a very large size sometimes weighing above twenty pounds <\s>
<s> this lordly creature seems to know that retiredness is a piece of majesty for it is scarcely ever caught or even seen except when it quits the depths of the lake in the spawning season and runs up into the streams where it is too often destroyed in disregard of the law of the land and of nature <\s>
<s> quitted the boat in the bay of sandwyke and pursued our way towards martindale along a pleasant path at first through a coppice bordering the lake then through green fields and came to the village if village it may be called for the houses are few and separated from each other a sequestered spot shut out from the view of the lake <\s>
<s> crossed the one arched bridge below the chapel with its bare ring of mossy wall and single yew tree <\s>
<s> at the last house in the dale we were greeted by the master who was sitting at his door with a flock of sheep collected round him for the purpose of smearing them with tar according to the custom of the season for protection against the winter's cold <\s>
<s> he invited us to enter and view a room built by mr <\s>
