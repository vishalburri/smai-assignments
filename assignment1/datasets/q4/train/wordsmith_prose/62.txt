<s> peter bell the poem <\s>
<s> founded upon an anecdote which i read in a newspaper of an ass being found hanging his head over a canal in a wretched posture <\s>
<s> upon examination a dead body was found in the water and proved to be the body of its master <\s>
<s> the countenance gait and figure of peter were taken from a wild rover with whom i walked from builth on the river wye downwards nearly as far as the town of hay <\s>
<s> he told me strange stories <\s>
<s> it has always been a pleasure to me through life to catch at every opportunity that has occurred in my rambles of becoming acquainted with this class of people <\s>
<s> the number of peter's wives was taken from the trespasses in this way of a lawless creature who lived in the county of durham and used to be attended by many women sometimes not less than half a dozen as disorderly as himself and a story went in the country that he had been heard to say while they were quarrelling why can't you be quiet there's none so many of you <\s>
<s> benoni or the child of sorrow i knew when i was a school boy <\s>
<s> his mother had been deserted by a gentleman in the neighbourhood she herself being a gentlewoman by birth <\s>
<s> the circumstances of her story were told me by my dear old dame ann tyson who was her confidante <\s>
<s> the lady died broken hearted <\s>
<s> in the woods of alfoxden i used to take great delight in noticing the habits tricks and physiognomy of asses and i have no doubt that i was thus put upon writing the poem out of liking for the creature that is so often dreadfully abused <\s>
<s> the crescent moon which makes such a figure in the prologue assumed this character one evening while i was watching its beauty in front of alfoxden house <\s>
<s> i intended this poem for the volume before spoken of but it was not published for more than twenty years afterwards <\s>
<s> the worship of the methodists or ranters is often heard during the stillness of the summer evening in the country with affecting accompaniments of rural beauty <\s>
<s> in both the psalmody and voice of the preacher there is not unfrequently much solemnity likely to impress the feelings of the rudest characters under favourable circumstances <\s>
<s> a potter sir he was by trade pt <\s>
<s> in the dialect of the north a hawker of earthenware is thus designated <\s>
<s> commencement of writing of sonnets <\s>
<s> in the cottage of town end one afternoon in 1801 my sister read to me the sonnets of milton <\s>
<s> i had long been well acquainted with them but i was particularly struck on that occasion with the dignified simplicity and majestic harmony that runs through most of them in character so totally different from the italian and still more so from shakespeare's fine sonnets <\s>
<s> i took fire if i may be allowed to say so and produced three sonnets the same afternoon the first i ever wrote except an irregular one at school <\s>
<s> of these three the only one i distinctly remember is i grieved for buonaparte c <\s>
<s> one was never written down the third which was i believe preserved i cannot particularise <\s>
<s> well mays't thou halt c <\s>
<s> ii intended more particularly for the perusal of those who have happened to be enamoured of some beautiful place of retreat in the country of the lakes <\s>
<s> it was thy wish c <\s>
<s> this was presented to me by sir george beaumont with a view to the erection of a house upon it for the sake of being near to coleridge then living and likely to remain at greta hall near keswick <\s>
<s> the severe necessities that prevented this arose from his domestic situation <\s>
<s> this little property with a considerable addition that still leaves it very small lies beautifully upon the banks of a rill that gurgles down the side of skiddaw and the orchard and other parts of the grounds command a magnificent prospect of derwent water the mountains of borrowdale and newlands <\s>
<s> not many years ago i gave the place to my daughter <\s>
<s> in pencil on opposite page in mrs <\s>
<s> quillinan's handwriting many years ago sir for it was given when she was a frail feeble monthling 186 <\s>
<s> there is a little unpretending rill <\s>
<s> this rill trickles down the hill side into windermere near lowood <\s>
<s> my sister and i on our first visit together to this part of the country walked from kendal and we rested to refresh ourselves by the side of the lake where the streamlet falls into it <\s>
<s> this sonnet was written some years after in recollection of that happy ramble that most happy day and hour <\s>
<s> the fairest brightest hues c <\s>
<s> suggested at hackett which is the craggy ridge that rises between the two langdales and looks towards windermere <\s>
<s> the cottage of hackett was often visited by us and at the time when this sonnet was written and long after was occupied by the husband and wife described in the excursion where it is mentioned that she was in the habit of walking in the front of the dwelling with a light to guide her husband home at night <\s>
<s> the same cottage is alluded to in the epistle to sir g <\s>
<s> beaumont as that from which the female peasant hailed us on our morning journey <\s>
<s> the musician mentioned in the sonnet was the rev <\s>

<s> such strains of rapture as the genius played <\s>
<s> see the vision of mirza in the spectator <\s>
<s> upon the sight of a beautiful picture <\s>
<s> this was written when we dwelt in the parsonage at grasmere <\s>
<s> the principal features of the picture are bredon hill and cloud hill near coleorton <\s>
<s> i shall never forget the happy feeling with which my heart was filled when i was impelled to compose this sonnet <\s>
<s> we resided only two years in this house and during the last half of this time which was after this poem had been written we lost our two children thomas and catherine <\s>
<s> our sorrow upon these events often brought it to my mind and cast me upon the support to which the last line of it gives expression the appropriate calm of blest eternity <\s>
<s> it is scarcely necessary to add that we still possess the picture <\s>
<s> a projecting point of loughrigg nearly in front of rydal mount <\s>
<s> thence looking at it you are struck with the boldness of its aspect but walking under it you admire the beauty of its details <\s>
<s> it is vulgarly called holme scar probably from the insulated pasture by the waterside below it <\s>
<s> the wild duck's nest <\s>
<s> i observed this beautiful nest on the largest island of rydal water <\s>
<s> grief thou hast lost c <\s>
<s> i could write a treatise of lamentation upon the changes brought about among the cottages of westmoreland by the silence of the spinning wheel <\s>
<s> during long winter's nights and wet days the wheel upon which wool was spun gave employment to a great part of a family <\s>
<s> the old man however infirm was able to card the wool as he sate in the corner by the fireside and often when a boy have i admired the cylinders of carded wool which were softly laid upon each other by his side <\s>
<s> two wheels were often at work on the same floor and others of the family chiefly the little children were occupied in teazing and clearing the wool to fit it for the hand of the carder <\s>
<s> so that all except the infants were contributing to mutual support such was the employment that prevailed in the pastoral vales <\s>
