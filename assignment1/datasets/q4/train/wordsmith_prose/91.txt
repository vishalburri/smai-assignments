<s> if you ever see her pray remember me affectionately to her and tell her that i have often been and still am troubled in conscience for having left her obliging letter so long unanswered but she must excuse me as there is not a motive in my mind urging me to throw any interest into my letters to friends beyond the expression of kindness and esteem and that she does not require from me <\s>
<s> besides my friends in general know how much i am hindered in all my pursuits by the inflammation to which my eyes are so frequently subject <\s>

<s> accompanies you we should be glad to see her also <\s>
<s> i hope that in the meeting about to take place in cambridge there will be less of mutual flattery among the men of science than appeared in that of the last year at oxford <\s>

<s> specimens of english sonnets criticisms c letter to the rev <\s>
<s> no date to this letter but written in 1833 my dear sir the dedication 136 which you propose i shall esteem as an honour nor do i conceive upon what ground but an over scrupulous modesty i could object to it <\s>
<s> 136 i had requested permission to dedicate a little book specimens of english sonnets to mr <\s>
<s> a d be assured that mr <\s>
<s> southey will not have the slightest unwillingness to your making any use you think proper of his memoir of bampfylde i shall not fail to mention the subject to him upon the first opportunity <\s>
<s> you propose to give specimens of the best sonnet writers in our language <\s>
<s> may i ask if by this be meant a selection of the best sonnets best both as to kind and degree <\s>
<s> a sonnet may be excellent in its kind but that kind of very inferior interest to one of a higher order though not perhaps in every minute particular quite so well executed and from the pen of a writer of inferior genius <\s>
<s> it should seem that the best rule to follow would be first to pitch upon the sonnets which are best both in kind and perfectness of execution and next those which although of a humbler quality are admirable for the finish and happiness of the execution taking care to exclude all those which have not one or other of these recommendations however striking they might be as characteristic of the age in which the author lived or some peculiarity of his manner <\s>
<s> the 10th sonnet of donne beginning death be not proud is so eminently characteristic of his manner and at the same time so weighty in the thought and vigorous in the expression that i would entreat you to insert it though to modern taste it may be repulsive quaint and laboured <\s>
<s> there are two sonnets of russell which in all probability you may have noticed could then the babes and the one upon philoctetes the last six lines of which are first rate <\s>
<s> southey's sonnet to winter pleases me much but above all among modern writers that of sir egerton brydges upon echo and silence <\s>
<s> miss williams's sonnet upon twilight is pleasing that upon hope of great merit <\s>
<s> do you mean to have a short preface upon the construction of the sonnet <\s>
<s> though i have written so many i have scarcely made up my own mind upon the subject <\s>
<s> it should seem that the sonnet like every other legitimate composition ought to have a beginning a middle and an end in other words to consist of three parts like the three propositions of a syllogism if such an illustration may be used <\s>
<s> but the frame of metre adopted by the italians does not accord with this view and as adhered to by them it seems to be if not arbitrary best fitted to a division of the sense into two parts of eight and six lines each <\s>
<s> milton however has not submitted to this in the better half of his sonnets the sense does not close with the rhyme at the eighth line but overflows into the second portion of the metre <\s>
<s> now it has struck me that this is not done merely to gratify the ear by variety and freedom of sound but also to aid in giving that pervading sense of intense unity in which the excellence of the sonnet has always seemed to me mainly to consist <\s>
<s> instead of looking at this composition as a piece of architecture making a whole out of three parts i have been much in the habit of preferring the image of an orbicular body a sphere or a dew drop <\s>
<s> all this will appear to you a little fanciful and i am well aware that a sonnet will often be found excellent where the beginning the middle and the end are distinctly marked and also where it is distinctly separated into two parts to which as i before observed the strict italian model as they write it is favourable <\s>
<s> of this last construction of sonnet russell's upon philoctetes is a fine specimen the first eight lines give the hardship of the case the six last the consolation or the per contra <\s>
<s> ever faithfully your much obliged friend and servant w <\s>
<s> in the case of the cumberland poet i overlooked a most pathetic circumstance <\s>
<s> while he was lying under the tree and his friends were saving what they could from the flames he desired them to bring out the box that contained his papers if possible <\s>
<s> a person went back for it but the bottom dropped out and the papers fell into the flames and were consumed <\s>
<s> immediately upon hearing this the poor old man expired 137 89 <\s>
