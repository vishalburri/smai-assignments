<s> sir g h b in the earlier part of his life was induced by his love of nature and the art of painting to take up his abode at old brathay about three miles from this spot so that he must have seen it the tarn under many aspects and he was so much pleased with it that he purchased the tarn with a view to build such a residence as is alluded to in this epistle <\s>

<s> many years afterwards a kendal tradesman born upon its banks applied to me for the purchase of it and accordingly it was sold for the sum that had been given for it and the money was laid out under my direction upon a substantial oak fence for a certain number of yew trees to be planted in grasmere churchyard <\s>
<s> two were planted in each enclosure with a view to remove after a certain time the one which throve the least <\s>
<s> after several years the stouter plant being left the others were taken up and placed in other parts of the same churchyard and were adequately fenced at the expense and under the care of the late mr <\s>
<s> the whole eight are now thriving and are an ornament to a place which during late years has lost much of its rustic simplicity by the introduction of iron palisades to fence off family burying grounds and by numerous monuments some of them in very bad taste from which this place of burial was in my memory quite free see the lines in the sixth book of the excursion beginning green is the churchyard <\s>
<s> the epistle to which these notes refer though written so far back as 1811 was carefully revised so late as 1842 previous to its publication <\s>

<s> since this epistle was written loughrigg tarn has lost much of its beauty by the felling of many natural clumps of wood relics of the old forest particularly upon the farm called the oaks from the abundance of that tree which grew there <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted upon public grounds that sir george beaumont did not carry into effect his intention of constructing here a summer retreat in the style i have described as his taste would have set an example how buildings with all the accommodations modern society requires might be introduced even into the most secluded parts of this country without injuring their native character <\s>
