<s> madam i have the honour to place in your majesty's hands the hitherto uncollected and unpublished prose works of william wordsworth name sufficient in its simpleness to give lustre to any page <\s>
<s> having been requested thus to collect and edit his prose writings by those who hold his mss <\s>
<s> and are his nearest representatives one little discovery or recovery among these mss <\s>
<s> suggested your majesty as the one among all others to whom the illustrious author would have chosen to dedicate these works viz <\s>
<s> a rough transcript of a poem which he had inscribed on the fly leaf of a gift copy of the collective edition of his poems sent to the royal library at windsor castle <\s>
<s> this very tender beautiful and pathetic poem will be found on the other side of this dedication <\s>
<s> it must for all time take its place beside the living laureate's imperishable verse tribute to your majesty <\s>
<s> i venture to thank your majesty for the double permission so appreciatively given of this dedication itself and to print for the first time the poem <\s>
<s> the gracious permission so pleasantly and discriminatingly signified is only one of abundant proofs that your majesty is aware that of the enduring names of the reign of victoria wordsworth's is supreme as poet and thinker <\s>
<s> gratefully and loyally alexander b <\s>
<s> to accept a lay no laureate offering of elaborate art but salutation taking its glad way from deep recesses of a loyal heart <\s>
<s> queen wife and mother <\s>
<s> may all judging heaven shower with a bounteous hand on thee and thine felicity that only can be given on earth to goodness blest by grace divine <\s>
<s> devoutly honoured and beloved through every realm confided to thy sway mayst thou pursue thy course by god approved and he will teach thy people to obey <\s>
<s> as thou art wont thy sovereignty adorn with woman's gentleness yet firm and staid so shall that earthly crown thy brows have worn be changed for one whose glory cannot fade <\s>
<s> and now by duty urged i lay this book before thy majesty in humble trust that on its simplest pages thou wilt look with a benign indulgence more than just <\s>
<s> nor wilt thou blame an aged poet's prayer that issuing hence may steal into thy mind some solace under weight of royal care or grief the inheritance of humankind <\s>
<s> for know we not that from celestial spheres when time was young an inspiration came oh were it mine to hallow saddest tears and help life onward in its noblest aim <\s>
<s> in response to a request put in the most gratifying way possible of the nearest representatives of wordsworth the editor has prepared this collection of his prose works <\s>
<s> that this should be done for the first time herein seems somewhat remarkable especially in the knowledge of the permanent value which the illustrious author attached to his prose and that he repeatedly expressed his wish and expectation that it would be thus brought together and published e g in the memoirs speaking of his own prose writings he said that but for coleridge's irregularity of purpose he should probably have left much more in that kind behind him <\s>
<s> when coleridge was proposing to publish his friend he wordsworth had offered contributions <\s>
<s> coleridge had expressed himself pleased with the offer but said i must arrange my principles for the work and when that is done i shall be glad of your aid <\s>
<s> but this arrangement of principles never took place <\s>
<s> wordsworth added i think my nephew dr <\s>
<s> wordsworth will after my death collect and publish all i have written in prose .... <\s>
<s> on another occasion i believe he intimated a desire that his works in prose should be edited by his son in law mr <\s>
<s> quillinan 1 similarly he wrote to professor reed in 1840 i am much pleased by what you say in your letter of the 18th may last upon the tract of the convention of cintra and i think myself with some interest upon its being reprinted hereafter along with my other writings in prose <\s>
<s> but the respect which in common with all the rest of the rational part of the world i bear for the duke of wellington will prevent my reprinting the pamphlet during his lifetime <\s>
<s> it has not been in my power to read the volumes of his despatches which i hear so highly spoken of but i am convinced that nothing they contain could alter my opinion of the injurious tendency of that or any other convention conducted upon such principles <\s>
<s> it was i repeat gratifying to me that you should have spoken of that work as you do and particularly that you should have considered it in relation to my poems somewhat in the same manner as you had done in respect to my little volume on the lakes 2 1 memoirs vol <\s>
<s> it is probable that the amount of the prose of wordsworth will come as a surprise surely a pleasant one on even his admirers and students <\s>
<s> his own use of tract to describe a goodly octavo volume and his calling his guide a little volume while it is a somewhat considerable one together with the hiding away of some of his most matterful and weightiest productions in local and fugitive publications and in prefaces and appendices to poems go far to explain the prevailing unacquaintance with even the extent not to speak of the importance of his prose and the light contentment with which it has been permitted so long to remain comparatively out of sight <\s>
<s> that the inter relation of the poems to the prose and of the prose to the poems of which above he himself wrote makes the collection and publication of the prose a duty to all who regard william wordsworth as one of the supreme intellects of the century as certainly the glory of the georgian and victorian age as ever shakespeare and raleigh were of the elizabethan and jacobean will not be questioned to day <\s>
<s> the present editor can only express his satisfaction at being called to execute a task which from a variety of circumstances has been too long delayed but only delayed inasmuch as the members of the poet's family have always held it as a sacred obligation laid upon them with the additional sanction that wordsworth's old and valued friend henry crabb robinson esq had expressed a wish in his last will 1868 that the prose works of his friend should one day be collected and which wish alone from one so discriminating and generous were there no other grounds for doing so the family of wordsworth could not but regard as imperative <\s>
<s> he rejoices that the delay otherwise to be regretted has enabled the editor to furnish a much fuller and more complete collection than earlier had perhaps been possible <\s>
