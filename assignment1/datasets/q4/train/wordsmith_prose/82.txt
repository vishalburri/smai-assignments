<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>

<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>

<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>

<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>

<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>

<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>

<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>
<s> it is there a beautiful river with its green bank and flat holms scattered over with trees <\s>
<s> four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us <\s>
<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> milton's sonnets transcribe all this for john as said by me to him i think manly and dignified compositions distinguished by simplicity and unity of object and aim and undisfigured by false or vicious ornaments <\s>
<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>
<s> it is there a beautiful river with its green bank and flat holms scattered over with trees <\s>
<s> four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us <\s>
<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>

<s> on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr <\s>
<s> we were received mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respect except perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher precisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> milton's sonnets transcribe all this for john as said by me to him i think manly and dignified compositions distinguished by simplicity and unity of object and aim and undisfigured by false or vicious ornaments <\s>
<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>

<s> four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us <\s>
<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>

<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>

<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>

<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>

<s> on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr <\s>
<s> we were received mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respect except perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher precisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>

<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>
<s> what a scene too in summer <\s>
<s> in the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding upon the pleasure which this cave in the heat of a july noon would spread through a frame exquisitely sensible <\s>

<s> on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr <\s>
<s> we were received mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respect except perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher precisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>

<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>

<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>

<s> their common acquaintance stoddart had so often talked of them to each other that they met as if they had not been strangers and they parted friends <\s>
<s> and miss wordsworth had just completed that tour in the highlands of which so many incidents have since been immortalised both in the poet's sense and in the hardly less poetical prose of his sister's diary <\s>
<s> on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr <\s>
<s> we were received mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respect except perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher precisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>

<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>
<s> it is there a beautiful river with its green bank and flat holms scattered over with trees <\s>
<s> four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us <\s>
<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>
<s> what a scene too in summer <\s>
<s> in the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding upon the pleasure which this cave in the heat of a july noon would spread through a frame exquisitely sensible <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>

<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>

<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>

<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>

<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>

<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>

<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>

<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>
<s> it is there a beautiful river with its green bank and flat holms scattered over with trees <\s>
<s> four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us <\s>
<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> milton's sonnets transcribe all this for john as said by me to him i think manly and dignified compositions distinguished by simplicity and unity of object and aim and undisfigured by false or vicious ornaments <\s>
<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>
<s> it is there a beautiful river with its green bank and flat holms scattered over with trees <\s>
<s> four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us <\s>
<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>

<s> on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr <\s>
<s> we were received mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respect except perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher precisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> milton's sonnets transcribe all this for john as said by me to him i think manly and dignified compositions distinguished by simplicity and unity of object and aim and undisfigured by false or vicious ornaments <\s>
<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>

<s> four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us <\s>
<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>

<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>

<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>

<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>

<s> on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr <\s>
<s> we were received mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respect except perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher precisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>

<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>
<s> what a scene too in summer <\s>
<s> in the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding upon the pleasure which this cave in the heat of a july noon would spread through a frame exquisitely sensible <\s>

<s> on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr <\s>
<s> we were received mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respect except perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher precisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>

<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>

<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>

<s> their common acquaintance stoddart had so often talked of them to each other that they met as if they had not been strangers and they parted friends <\s>
<s> and miss wordsworth had just completed that tour in the highlands of which so many incidents have since been immortalised both in the poet's sense and in the hardly less poetical prose of his sister's diary <\s>
<s> on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr <\s>
<s> we were received mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respect except perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher precisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world <\s>

<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>

<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>
<s> it is there a beautiful river with its green bank and flat holms scattered over with trees <\s>
<s> four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us <\s>
<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>
<s> what a scene too in summer <\s>
<s> in the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding upon the pleasure which this cave in the heat of a july noon would spread through a frame exquisitely sensible <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>

<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>

<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>

<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>

<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>

<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>

<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>

<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
<s> the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered with water plants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant <\s>
<s> i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed <\s>

<s> wordsworth 49 49 life of scott by lockhart vol <\s>
<s> the following from the same source earlier may fitly find a place here it was in the september of this year 1803 that scott first saw wordsworth <\s>
<s> their common acquaintance stoddart had so often talked of them to each other that they met as if they had not been strangers and they parted friends <\s>
<s> and miss wordsworth had just completed that tour in the highlands of which so many incidents have since been immortalised both in the poet's sense and in the hardly less poetical prose of his sister's diary <\s>
<s> on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr <\s>
<s> we were received mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respect except perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher precisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world <\s>
<s> he partly read and partly recited sometimes in an enthusiastic style of chant the first four cantos of the lay of the last minstrel and the novelty of the manners the clear picturesque descriptions and the easy glowing energy of much of the verse greatly delighted me pp <\s>
<s> the grove captain john wordsworth <\s>
<s> john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmas day 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny east indiaman in the spring of 1801 <\s>
<s> after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brother's steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering fir grove above the cottage and henceforth that fir grove was known to the poet's household by the name of john's grove or brother's grove <\s>
<s> of this wordsworth writes when to the attractions of the busy world 1805 the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described <\s>
<s> the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at town end 50 28 <\s>
<s> captain wordsworth returned from the voyage on which he sailed in 1801 and in november 1802 he writes for directions what books to buy to carry with him on a voyage of sixteen months .... <\s>
<s> tell john says wordsworth when he buys spenser to purchase an edition which has his state of ireland in it <\s>
<s> this is in prose <\s>
<s> this edition may be scarce but one surely can be found <\s>
<s> milton's sonnets transcribe all this for john as said by me to him i think manly and dignified compositions distinguished by simplicity and unity of object and aim and undisfigured by false or vicious ornaments <\s>
<s> we left sockburn last tuesday morning <\s>
<s> we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale <\s>
<s> it is there a beautiful river with its green bank and flat holms scattered over with trees <\s>
<s> four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us <\s>
<s> the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it <\s>
<s> george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts <\s>
<s> we were now in wensley dale and d orothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal <\s>
<s> i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr <\s>
<s> it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task <\s>
<s> tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeth's courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together <\s>
<s> by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild <\s>
<s> we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet <\s>
<s> next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery <\s>
<s> on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall <\s>
<s> it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour <\s>
<s> after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade <\s>
<s> as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current <\s>
<s> the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh <\s>
<s> how far we were from it <\s>
<s> the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both <\s>
<s> when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley <\s>
<s> it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active <\s>
<s> we had a task of twenty one miles to perform in a short winter's day <\s>
<s> all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene <\s>
<s> on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle <\s>
<s> we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated <\s>
<s> when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts <\s>
<s> i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles <\s>
<s> twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm <\s>
<s> we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brook side to take a view of a third waterfall <\s>
<s> we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason <\s>
<s> we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty <\s>
<s> we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me <\s>
<s> after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth <\s>
<s> the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful <\s>
<s> the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour <\s>
<s> on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up <\s>
<s> each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment <\s>
<s> sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower <\s>
<s> in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky <\s>
<s> large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant <\s>
<s> the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water <\s>
<s> each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty <\s>
