<s> these were somewhat mortified to find their notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet who seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own genius <\s>

<s> the subject of the work is the changes produced in the appearances of nature by the revolution of the year and by undertaking to write in verse thomson pledged himself to treat his subject as became a poet <\s>
<s> now it is remarkable that excepting the nocturnal reverie of lady winchilsea and a passage or two in the windsor forest of pope the poetry of the period intervening between the publication of the paradise lost and the seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature and scarcely presents a familiar one from which it can be inferred that the eye of the poet had been steadily fixed upon his object much less that his feelings had urged him to work upon it in the spirit of genuine imagination <\s>
<s> to what a low state knowledge of the most obvious and important phenomena had sunk is evident from the style in which dryden has executed a description of night in one of his tragedies and pope his translation of the celebrated moonlight scene in the iliad <\s>

<s> the verses of dryden once highly celebrated are forgotten those of pope still retain their hold upon public estimation nay there is not a passage of descriptive poetry which at this day finds so many and such ardent admirers <\s>
<s> strange to think of an enthusiast as may have been the case with thousands reciting those verses under the cope of a moonlight sky without having his raptures in the least disturbed by a suspicion of their absurdity if these two distinguished writers could habitually think that the visible universe was of so little consequence to a poet that it was scarcely necessary for him to cast his eyes upon it we may be assured that those passages of the older poets which faithfully and poetically describe the phenomena of nature were not at that time holden in much estimation and that there was little accurate attention paid to those appearances <\s>

<s> thomson was an inspired poet but he could not work miracles in cases where the art of seeing had in some degree been learned the teacher would further the proficiency of his pupils but he could do little more though so far does vanity assist men in acts of self deception that many would often fancy they recognised a likeness when they knew nothing of the original <\s>
<s> having shown that much of what his biographer deemed genuine admiration must in fact have been blind wonderment how is the rest to be accounted for thomson was fortunate in the very title of his poem which seemed to bring it home to the prepared sympathies of every one in the next place notwithstanding his high powers he writes a vicious style and his false ornaments are exactly of that kind which would be most likely to strike the undiscerning <\s>
<s> he likewise abounds with sentimental common places that from the manner in which they were brought forward bore an imposing air of novelty <\s>
<s> in any well used copy of the seasons the book generally opens of itself with the rhapsody on love or with one of the stories perhaps damon and musidora ); these also are prominent in our collections of extracts and are the parts of his work which after all were probably most efficient in first recommending the author to general notice <\s>
<s> pope repaying praises which he had received and wishing to extol him to the highest only styles him an elegant and philosophical poet nor are we able to collect any unquestionable proofs that the true characteristics of thomson's genius as an imaginative poet 15 were perceived till the elder warton almost forty years after the publication of the seasons pointed them out by a note in his essay on the life and writings of pope <\s>
<s> in the castle of indolence of which gray speaks so coldly these characteristics were almost as conspicuously displayed and in verse more harmonious and diction more pure <\s>

<s> to such his manly classical spirit could not readily commend itself till after a more attentive perusal they had got the better of their prejudices and either acquired or affected a truer taste <\s>
<s> a few others stood aloof merely because they had long before fixed the articles of their poetical creed and resigned themselves to an absolute despair of ever seeing any thing new and original <\s>
<s> these were somewhat mortified to find their notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet who seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own genius <\s>
<s> but in a short time the applause became unanimous every one wondering how so many pictures and pictures so familiar should have moved them but faintly to what they felt in his descriptions <\s>
<s> his digressions too the overflowings of a tender benevolent heart charmed the reader no less leaving him in doubt whether he should more admire the poet or love the man <\s>
<s> this case appears to bear strongly against us but we must distinguish between wonder and legitimate admiration <\s>
<s> the subject of the work is the changes produced in the appearances of nature by the revolution of the year and by undertaking to write in verse thomson pledged himself to treat his subject as became a poet <\s>
<s> now it is remarkable that excepting the nocturnal reverie of lady winchilsea and a passage or two in the windsor forest of pope the poetry of the period intervening between the publication of the paradise lost and the seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature and scarcely presents a familiar one from which it can be inferred that the eye of the poet had been steadily fixed upon his object much less that his feelings had urged him to work upon it in the spirit of genuine imagination <\s>

<s> thirteen hundred copies were sold in two years an uncommon example he asserts of the prevalence of genius in opposition to so much recent enmity as milton's public conduct had excited <\s>

<s> these were somewhat mortified to find their notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet who seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own genius <\s>

<s> in any well used copy of the seasons the book generally opens of itself with the rhapsody on love or with one of the stories perhaps damon and musidora ); these also are prominent in our collections of extracts and are the parts of his work which after all were probably most efficient in first recommending the author to general notice <\s>
<s> pope repaying praises which he had received and wishing to extol him to the highest only styles him an elegant and philosophical poet nor are we able to collect any unquestionable proofs that the true characteristics of thomson's genius as an imaginative poet 15 were perceived till the elder warton almost forty years after the publication of the seasons pointed them out by a note in his essay on the life and writings of pope <\s>
<s> in the castle of indolence of which gray speaks so coldly these characteristics were almost as conspicuously displayed and in verse more harmonious and diction more pure <\s>

<s> a dramatic author if he write for the stage must adapt himself to the taste of the audience or they will not endure him accordingly the mighty genius of shakspeare was listened to <\s>
<s> the people were delighted but i am not sufficiently versed in stage antiquities to determine whether they did not flock as eagerly to the representation of many pieces of contemporary authors wholly undeserving to appear upon the same boards <\s>
<s> had there been a formal contest for superiority among dramatic writers that shakspeare like his predecessors sophocles and euripides would have often been subject to the mortification of seeing the prize adjudged to sorry competitors becomes too probable when we reflect that the admirers of settle and shadwell were in a later age as numerous and reckoned as respectable in point of talent as those of dryden <\s>
<s> at all events that shakspeare stooped to accommodate himself to the people is sufficiently apparent and one of the most striking proofs of his almost omnipotent genius is that he could turn to such glorious purpose those materials which the prepossessions of the age compelled him to make use of <\s>
<s> yet even this marvellous skill appears not to have been enough to prevent his rivals from having some advantage over him in public estimation else how can we account for passages and scenes that exist in his works unless upon a supposition that some of the grossest of them a fact which in my own mind i have no doubt of were foisted in by the players for the gratification of the many <\s>
<s> but that his works whatever might be their reception upon the stage made but little impression upon the ruling intellects of the time may be inferred from the fact that lord bacon in his multifarious writings nowhere either quotes or alludes to him 10 his dramatic excellence enabled him to resume possession of the stage after the restoration but dryden tells us that in his time two of the plays of beaumont and fletcher were acted for one of shakspeare's <\s>
<s> and so faint and limited was the perception of the poetic beauties of his dramas in the time of pope that in his edition of the plays with a view of rendering to the general reader a necessary service he printed between inverted commas those passages which he thought most worthy of notice <\s>
<s> 10 the learned hakewill a third edition of whose book bears date 1635 writing to refute the error touching nature's perpetual and universal decay cites triumphantly the names of ariosto tasso bartas and spenser as instances that poetic genius had not degenerated but he makes no mention of shakspeare <\s>
<s> at this day the french critics have abated nothing of their aversion to this darling of our nation the english with their bouffon de shakspeare is as familiar an expression among them as in the time of voltaire <\s>
<s> baron grimm is the only french writer who seems to have perceived his infinite superiority to the first names of the french theatre an advantage which the parisian critic owed to his german blood and german education <\s>
<s> the most enlightened italians though well acquainted with our language are wholly incompetent to measure the proportions of shakspeare <\s>
<s> the germans only of foreign nations are approaching towards a knowledge and feeling of what he is <\s>
<s> in some respects they have acquired a superiority over the fellow countrymen of the poet for among us it is a current i might say an established opinion that shakspeare is justly praised when he is pronounced to be a wild irregular genius in whom great faults are compensated by great beauties <\s>
<s> how long may it be before this misconception passes away and it becomes universally acknowledged that the judgment of shakspeare in the selection of his materials and in the manner in which he has made them heterogeneous as they often are constitute a unity of their own and contribute all to one great end is not less admirable than his imagination his invention and his intuitive knowledge of human nature <\s>
<s> there is extant a small volume of miscellaneous poems in which shakspeare expresses his own feelings in his own person <\s>
<s> it is not difficult to conceive that the editor george steevens should have been insensible to the beauties of one portion of that volume the sonnets though in no part of the writings of this poet is found in an equal compass a greater number of exquisite feelings felicitously expressed <\s>
<s> but from regard to the critic's own credit he would not have ventured to talk of an 11 act of parliament not being strong enough to compel the perusal of those little pieces if he had not known that the people of england were ignorant of the treasures contained in them and if he had not moreover shared the too common propensity of human nature to exult over a supposed fall into the mire of a genius whom he had been compelled to regard with admiration as an inmate of the celestial regions 'there sitting where he durst not soar <\s>

<s> nine years before the death of shakspeare milton was born and early in life he published several small poems which though on their first appearance they were praised by a few of the judicious were afterwards neglected to that degree that pope in his youth could borrow from them without risk of its being known <\s>

<s> to such his manly classical spirit could not readily commend itself till after a more attentive perusal they had got the better of their prejudices and either acquired or affected a truer taste <\s>
<s> a few others stood aloof merely because they had long before fixed the articles of their poetical creed and resigned themselves to an absolute despair of ever seeing any thing new and original <\s>
<s> these were somewhat mortified to find their notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet who seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own genius <\s>
<s> but in a short time the applause became unanimous every one wondering how so many pictures and pictures so familiar should have moved them but faintly to what they felt in his descriptions <\s>
<s> his digressions too the overflowings of a tender benevolent heart charmed the reader no less leaving him in doubt whether he should more admire the poet or love the man <\s>
<s> this case appears to bear strongly against us but we must distinguish between wonder and legitimate admiration <\s>
<s> the subject of the work is the changes produced in the appearances of nature by the revolution of the year and by undertaking to write in verse thomson pledged himself to treat his subject as became a poet <\s>
<s> now it is remarkable that excepting the nocturnal reverie of lady winchilsea and a passage or two in the windsor forest of pope the poetry of the period intervening between the publication of the paradise lost and the seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature and scarcely presents a familiar one from which it can be inferred that the eye of the poet had been steadily fixed upon his object much less that his feelings had urged him to work upon it in the spirit of genuine imagination <\s>
<s> to what a low state knowledge of the most obvious and important phenomena had sunk is evident from the style in which dryden has executed a description of night in one of his tragedies and pope his translation of the celebrated moonlight scene in the iliad <\s>

<s> the verses of dryden once highly celebrated are forgotten those of pope still retain their hold upon public estimation nay there is not a passage of descriptive poetry which at this day finds so many and such ardent admirers <\s>
<s> strange to think of an enthusiast as may have been the case with thousands reciting those verses under the cope of a moonlight sky without having his raptures in the least disturbed by a suspicion of their absurdity if these two distinguished writers could habitually think that the visible universe was of so little consequence to a poet that it was scarcely necessary for him to cast his eyes upon it we may be assured that those passages of the older poets which faithfully and poetically describe the phenomena of nature were not at that time holden in much estimation and that there was little accurate attention paid to those appearances <\s>

<s> thomson was an inspired poet but he could not work miracles in cases where the art of seeing had in some degree been learned the teacher would further the proficiency of his pupils but he could do little more though so far does vanity assist men in acts of self deception that many would often fancy they recognised a likeness when they knew nothing of the original <\s>
<s> having shown that much of what his biographer deemed genuine admiration must in fact have been blind wonderment how is the rest to be accounted for thomson was fortunate in the very title of his poem which seemed to bring it home to the prepared sympathies of every one in the next place notwithstanding his high powers he writes a vicious style and his false ornaments are exactly of that kind which would be most likely to strike the undiscerning <\s>
<s> he likewise abounds with sentimental common places that from the manner in which they were brought forward bore an imposing air of novelty <\s>
<s> in any well used copy of the seasons the book generally opens of itself with the rhapsody on love or with one of the stories perhaps damon and musidora ); these also are prominent in our collections of extracts and are the parts of his work which after all were probably most efficient in first recommending the author to general notice <\s>
<s> pope repaying praises which he had received and wishing to extol him to the highest only styles him an elegant and philosophical poet nor are we able to collect any unquestionable proofs that the true characteristics of thomson's genius as an imaginative poet 15 were perceived till the elder warton almost forty years after the publication of the seasons pointed them out by a note in his essay on the life and writings of pope <\s>
<s> in the castle of indolence of which gray speaks so coldly these characteristics were almost as conspicuously displayed and in verse more harmonious and diction more pure <\s>

<s> 15 since these observations upon thomson were written i have perused the second edition of his seasons and find that even that does not contain the most striking passages which warton points out for admiration these with other improvements throughout the whole work must have been added at a later period <\s>

<s> it was no sooner read says one of his contemporary biographers than universally admired those only excepted who had not been used to feel or to look for any thing in poetry beyond a point of satirical or epigrammatic wit a smart antithesis richly trimmed with rhyme or the softness of an elegiac complaint <\s>
<s> to such his manly classical spirit could not readily commend itself till after a more attentive perusal they had got the better of their prejudices and either acquired or affected a truer taste <\s>
<s> a few others stood aloof merely because they had long before fixed the articles of their poetical creed and resigned themselves to an absolute despair of ever seeing any thing new and original <\s>
<s> these were somewhat mortified to find their notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet who seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own genius <\s>
<s> but in a short time the applause became unanimous every one wondering how so many pictures and pictures so familiar should have moved them but faintly to what they felt in his descriptions <\s>
<s> his digressions too the overflowings of a tender benevolent heart charmed the reader no less leaving him in doubt whether he should more admire the poet or love the man <\s>
<s> this case appears to bear strongly against us but we must distinguish between wonder and legitimate admiration <\s>
<s> the subject of the work is the changes produced in the appearances of nature by the revolution of the year and by undertaking to write in verse thomson pledged himself to treat his subject as became a poet <\s>
<s> now it is remarkable that excepting the nocturnal reverie of lady winchilsea and a passage or two in the windsor forest of pope the poetry of the period intervening between the publication of the paradise lost and the seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature and scarcely presents a familiar one from which it can be inferred that the eye of the poet had been steadily fixed upon his object much less that his feelings had urged him to work upon it in the spirit of genuine imagination <\s>
<s> to what a low state knowledge of the most obvious and important phenomena had sunk is evident from the style in which dryden has executed a description of night in one of his tragedies and pope his translation of the celebrated moonlight scene in the iliad <\s>
<s> a blind man in the habit of attending accurately to descriptions casually dropped from the lips of those around him might easily depict these appearances with more truth <\s>
<s> dryden's lines are vague bombastic and senseless ;[ 14 those of pope though he had homer to guide him are throughout false and contradictory <\s>
<s> the verses of dryden once highly celebrated are forgotten those of pope still retain their hold upon public estimation nay there is not a passage of descriptive poetry which at this day finds so many and such ardent admirers <\s>
<s> strange to think of an enthusiast as may have been the case with thousands reciting those verses under the cope of a moonlight sky without having his raptures in the least disturbed by a suspicion of their absurdity if these two distinguished writers could habitually think that the visible universe was of so little consequence to a poet that it was scarcely necessary for him to cast his eyes upon it we may be assured that those passages of the older poets which faithfully and poetically describe the phenomena of nature were not at that time holden in much estimation and that there was little accurate attention paid to those appearances <\s>

<s> the germans only of foreign nations are approaching towards a knowledge and feeling of what he is <\s>
<s> in some respects they have acquired a superiority over the fellow countrymen of the poet for among us it is a current i might say an established opinion that shakspeare is justly praised when he is pronounced to be a wild irregular genius in whom great faults are compensated by great beauties <\s>
<s> how long may it be before this misconception passes away and it becomes universally acknowledged that the judgment of shakspeare in the selection of his materials and in the manner in which he has made them heterogeneous as they often are constitute a unity of their own and contribute all to one great end is not less admirable than his imagination his invention and his intuitive knowledge of human nature <\s>
<s> there is extant a small volume of miscellaneous poems in which shakspeare expresses his own feelings in his own person <\s>
<s> it is not difficult to conceive that the editor george steevens should have been insensible to the beauties of one portion of that volume the sonnets though in no part of the writings of this poet is found in an equal compass a greater number of exquisite feelings felicitously expressed <\s>

<s> nine years before the death of shakspeare milton was born and early in life he published several small poems which though on their first appearance they were praised by a few of the judicious were afterwards neglected to that degree that pope in his youth could borrow from them without risk of its being known <\s>

<s> nine years before the death of shakspeare milton was born and early in life he published several small poems which though on their first appearance they were praised by a few of the judicious were afterwards neglected to that degree that pope in his youth could borrow from them without risk of its being known <\s>

<s> thirteen hundred copies were sold in two years an uncommon example he asserts of the prevalence of genius in opposition to so much recent enmity as milton's public conduct had excited <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that if milton's political and religious opinions and the manner in which he announced them had raised him many enemies they had procured him numerous friends who as all personal danger was passed away at the time of publication would be eager to procure the master work of a man whom they revered and whom they would be proud of praising <\s>

<s> what further demand there might be for these works i do not know but i well remember that twenty five years ago the booksellers stalls in london swarmed with the folios of cowley <\s>
<s> this is not mentioned in disparagement of that able writer and amiable man but merely to show that if milton's work were not more read it was not because readers did not exist at the time <\s>
<s> the early editions of the paradise lost were printed in a shape which allowed them to be sold at a low price yet only three thousand copies of the work were sold in eleven years and the nation says dr <\s>
<s> johnson had been satisfied from 1623 to 1664 that is forty one years with only two editions of the works of shakspeare which probably did not together make one thousand copies facts adduced by the critic to prove the paucity of readers there were readers in multitudes but their money went for other purposes as their admiration was fixed elsewhere <\s>
<s> we are authorized then to affirm that the reception of the paradise lost and the slow progress of its fame are proofs as striking as can be desired that the positions which i am attempting to establish are not erroneous 12 how amusing to shape to one's self such a critique as a wit of charles's days or a lord of the miscellanies or trading journalist of king william's time would have brought forth if he had set his faculties industriously to work upon this poem every where impregnated with original excellence <\s>

<s> to such his manly classical spirit could not readily commend itself till after a more attentive perusal they had got the better of their prejudices and either acquired or affected a truer taste <\s>
<s> a few others stood aloof merely because they had long before fixed the articles of their poetical creed and resigned themselves to an absolute despair of ever seeing any thing new and original <\s>
<s> these were somewhat mortified to find their notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet who seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own genius <\s>
<s> but in a short time the applause became unanimous every one wondering how so many pictures and pictures so familiar should have moved them but faintly to what they felt in his descriptions <\s>
<s> his digressions too the overflowings of a tender benevolent heart charmed the reader no less leaving him in doubt whether he should more admire the poet or love the man <\s>
<s> this case appears to bear strongly against us but we must distinguish between wonder and legitimate admiration <\s>
<s> the subject of the work is the changes produced in the appearances of nature by the revolution of the year and by undertaking to write in verse thomson pledged himself to treat his subject as became a poet <\s>
<s> now it is remarkable that excepting the nocturnal reverie of lady winchilsea and a passage or two in the windsor forest of pope the poetry of the period intervening between the publication of the paradise lost and the seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature and scarcely presents a familiar one from which it can be inferred that the eye of the poet had been steadily fixed upon his object much less that his feelings had urged him to work upon it in the spirit of genuine imagination <\s>
<s> to what a low state knowledge of the most obvious and important phenomena had sunk is evident from the style in which dryden has executed a description of night in one of his tragedies and pope his translation of the celebrated moonlight scene in the iliad <\s>

<s> the verses of dryden once highly celebrated are forgotten those of pope still retain their hold upon public estimation nay there is not a passage of descriptive poetry which at this day finds so many and such ardent admirers <\s>
<s> strange to think of an enthusiast as may have been the case with thousands reciting those verses under the cope of a moonlight sky without having his raptures in the least disturbed by a suspicion of their absurdity if these two distinguished writers could habitually think that the visible universe was of so little consequence to a poet that it was scarcely necessary for him to cast his eyes upon it we may be assured that those passages of the older poets which faithfully and poetically describe the phenomena of nature were not at that time holden in much estimation and that there was little accurate attention paid to those appearances <\s>

<s> neither individuals nor nations become corrupt all at once nor are they enlightened in a moment <\s>
<s> thomson was an inspired poet but he could not work miracles in cases where the art of seeing had in some degree been learned the teacher would further the proficiency of his pupils but he could do little more though so far does vanity assist men in acts of self deception that many would often fancy they recognised a likeness when they knew nothing of the original <\s>
<s> having shown that much of what his biographer deemed genuine admiration must in fact have been blind wonderment how is the rest to be accounted for thomson was fortunate in the very title of his poem which seemed to bring it home to the prepared sympathies of every one in the next place notwithstanding his high powers he writes a vicious style and his false ornaments are exactly of that kind which would be most likely to strike the undiscerning <\s>
<s> he likewise abounds with sentimental common places that from the manner in which they were brought forward bore an imposing air of novelty <\s>
<s> in any well used copy of the seasons the book generally opens of itself with the rhapsody on love or with one of the stories perhaps damon and musidora ); these also are prominent in our collections of extracts and are the parts of his work which after all were probably most efficient in first recommending the author to general notice <\s>
<s> pope repaying praises which he had received and wishing to extol him to the highest only styles him an elegant and philosophical poet nor are we able to collect any unquestionable proofs that the true characteristics of thomson's genius as an imaginative poet 15 were perceived till the elder warton almost forty years after the publication of the seasons pointed them out by a note in his essay on the life and writings of pope <\s>
<s> in the castle of indolence of which gray speaks so coldly these characteristics were almost as conspicuously displayed and in verse more harmonious and diction more pure <\s>
<s> yet that fine poem was neglected on its appearance and is at this day the delight only of a few <\s>
<s> 15 since these observations upon thomson were written i have perused the second edition of his seasons and find that even that does not contain the most striking passages which warton points out for admiration these with other improvements throughout the whole work must have been added at a later period <\s>
<s> when thomson died collins breathed forth his regrets in an elegiac poem in which he pronounces a poetical curse upon him who should regard with insensibility the place where the poet's remains were deposited <\s>
<s> the poems of the mourner himself have now passed through innumerable editions and are universally known but if when collins died the same kind of imprecation had been pronounced by a surviving admirer small is the number whom it would not have comprehended <\s>
<s> the notice which his poems attained during his life time was so small and of course the sale so insignificant that not long before his death he deemed it right to repay to the bookseller the sum which he had advanced for them and threw the edition into the fire <\s>
<s> the name of spenser whose genius is of a higher order than even that of ariosto is at this day scarcely known beyond the limits of the british isles <\s>
<s> and if the value of his works is to be estimated from the attention now paid to them by his countrymen compared with that which they bestow on those of some other writers it must be pronounced small indeed <\s>
<s> the laurel meed of mighty conquerors and poets sage are his own words but his wisdom has in this particular been his worst enemy while its opposite whether in the shape of folly or madness has been their best friend <\s>
<s> but he was a great power and bears a high name the laurel has been awarded to him <\s>
<s> a dramatic author if he write for the stage must adapt himself to the taste of the audience or they will not endure him accordingly the mighty genius of shakspeare was listened to <\s>
<s> the people were delighted but i am not sufficiently versed in stage antiquities to determine whether they did not flock as eagerly to the representation of many pieces of contemporary authors wholly undeserving to appear upon the same boards <\s>
<s> had there been a formal contest for superiority among dramatic writers that shakspeare like his predecessors sophocles and euripides would have often been subject to the mortification of seeing the prize adjudged to sorry competitors becomes too probable when we reflect that the admirers of settle and shadwell were in a later age as numerous and reckoned as respectable in point of talent as those of dryden <\s>
<s> at all events that shakspeare stooped to accommodate himself to the people is sufficiently apparent and one of the most striking proofs of his almost omnipotent genius is that he could turn to such glorious purpose those materials which the prepossessions of the age compelled him to make use of <\s>
<s> yet even this marvellous skill appears not to have been enough to prevent his rivals from having some advantage over him in public estimation else how can we account for passages and scenes that exist in his works unless upon a supposition that some of the grossest of them a fact which in my own mind i have no doubt of were foisted in by the players for the gratification of the many <\s>
<s> but that his works whatever might be their reception upon the stage made but little impression upon the ruling intellects of the time may be inferred from the fact that lord bacon in his multifarious writings nowhere either quotes or alludes to him 10 his dramatic excellence enabled him to resume possession of the stage after the restoration but dryden tells us that in his time two of the plays of beaumont and fletcher were acted for one of shakspeare's <\s>
<s> and so faint and limited was the perception of the poetic beauties of his dramas in the time of pope that in his edition of the plays with a view of rendering to the general reader a necessary service he printed between inverted commas those passages which he thought most worthy of notice <\s>
<s> 10 the learned hakewill a third edition of whose book bears date 1635 writing to refute the error touching nature's perpetual and universal decay cites triumphantly the names of ariosto tasso bartas and spenser as instances that poetic genius had not degenerated but he makes no mention of shakspeare <\s>

<s> he bewitched the nation by his melody and dazzled it by his polished style and was himself blinded by his own success <\s>
<s> having wandered from humanity in his eclogues with boyish inexperience the praise which these compositions obtained tempted him into a belief that nature was not to be trusted at least in pastoral poetry <\s>

<s> something less than sixty years after the publication of the paradise lost appeared thomson's winter which was speedily followed by his other seasons <\s>
<s> it is a work of inspiration much of it is written from himself and nobly from himself <\s>
<s> how was it received <\s>
<s> it was no sooner read says one of his contemporary biographers than universally admired those only excepted who had not been used to feel or to look for any thing in poetry beyond a point of satirical or epigrammatic wit a smart antithesis richly trimmed with rhyme or the softness of an elegiac complaint <\s>
<s> to such his manly classical spirit could not readily commend itself till after a more attentive perusal they had got the better of their prejudices and either acquired or affected a truer taste <\s>
<s> a few others stood aloof merely because they had long before fixed the articles of their poetical creed and resigned themselves to an absolute despair of ever seeing any thing new and original <\s>
<s> these were somewhat mortified to find their notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet who seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own genius <\s>
<s> but in a short time the applause became unanimous every one wondering how so many pictures and pictures so familiar should have moved them but faintly to what they felt in his descriptions <\s>
<s> his digressions too the overflowings of a tender benevolent heart charmed the reader no less leaving him in doubt whether he should more admire the poet or love the man <\s>
<s> this case appears to bear strongly against us but we must distinguish between wonder and legitimate admiration <\s>
<s> the subject of the work is the changes produced in the appearances of nature by the revolution of the year and by undertaking to write in verse thomson pledged himself to treat his subject as became a poet <\s>
<s> now it is remarkable that excepting the nocturnal reverie of lady winchilsea and a passage or two in the windsor forest of pope the poetry of the period intervening between the publication of the paradise lost and the seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature and scarcely presents a familiar one from which it can be inferred that the eye of the poet had been steadily fixed upon his object much less that his feelings had urged him to work upon it in the spirit of genuine imagination <\s>
<s> to what a low state knowledge of the most obvious and important phenomena had sunk is evident from the style in which dryden has executed a description of night in one of his tragedies and pope his translation of the celebrated moonlight scene in the iliad <\s>
<s> a blind man in the habit of attending accurately to descriptions casually dropped from the lips of those around him might easily depict these appearances with more truth <\s>
<s> dryden's lines are vague bombastic and senseless ;[ 14 those of pope though he had homer to guide him are throughout false and contradictory <\s>
<s> the verses of dryden once highly celebrated are forgotten those of pope still retain their hold upon public estimation nay there is not a passage of descriptive poetry which at this day finds so many and such ardent admirers <\s>
<s> strange to think of an enthusiast as may have been the case with thousands reciting those verses under the cope of a moonlight sky without having his raptures in the least disturbed by a suspicion of their absurdity if these two distinguished writers could habitually think that the visible universe was of so little consequence to a poet that it was scarcely necessary for him to cast his eyes upon it we may be assured that those passages of the older poets which faithfully and poetically describe the phenomena of nature were not at that time holden in much estimation and that there was little accurate attention paid to those appearances <\s>

<s> wonder is the natural product of ignorance and as the soil was in such good condition at the time of the publication of the seasons the crop was doubtless abundant <\s>
<s> neither individuals nor nations become corrupt all at once nor are they enlightened in a moment <\s>
<s> thomson was an inspired poet but he could not work miracles in cases where the art of seeing had in some degree been learned the teacher would further the proficiency of his pupils but he could do little more though so far does vanity assist men in acts of self deception that many would often fancy they recognised a likeness when they knew nothing of the original <\s>
<s> having shown that much of what his biographer deemed genuine admiration must in fact have been blind wonderment how is the rest to be accounted for thomson was fortunate in the very title of his poem which seemed to bring it home to the prepared sympathies of every one in the next place notwithstanding his high powers he writes a vicious style and his false ornaments are exactly of that kind which would be most likely to strike the undiscerning <\s>
<s> he likewise abounds with sentimental common places that from the manner in which they were brought forward bore an imposing air of novelty <\s>
<s> in any well used copy of the seasons the book generally opens of itself with the rhapsody on love or with one of the stories perhaps damon and musidora ); these also are prominent in our collections of extracts and are the parts of his work which after all were probably most efficient in first recommending the author to general notice <\s>
<s> pope repaying praises which he had received and wishing to extol him to the highest only styles him an elegant and philosophical poet nor are we able to collect any unquestionable proofs that the true characteristics of thomson's genius as an imaginative poet 15 were perceived till the elder warton almost forty years after the publication of the seasons pointed them out by a note in his essay on the life and writings of pope <\s>

<s> how long may it be before this misconception passes away and it becomes universally acknowledged that the judgment of shakspeare in the selection of his materials and in the manner in which he has made them heterogeneous as they often are constitute a unity of their own and contribute all to one great end is not less admirable than his imagination his invention and his intuitive knowledge of human nature <\s>
<s> there is extant a small volume of miscellaneous poems in which shakspeare expresses his own feelings in his own person <\s>

<s> nine years before the death of shakspeare milton was born and early in life he published several small poems which though on their first appearance they were praised by a few of the judicious were afterwards neglected to that degree that pope in his youth could borrow from them without risk of its being known <\s>
<s> whether these poems are at this day justly appreciated i will not undertake to decide nor would it imply a severe reflection upon the mass of readers to suppose the contrary seeing that a man of the acknowledged genius of voss the german poet could suffer their spirit to evaporate and could change their character as is done in the translation made by him of the most popular of those pieces <\s>

<s> johnson has fallen into a gross mistake when he attempts to prove by the sale of the work that milton's countrymen were just to it upon its first appearance <\s>
<s> thirteen hundred copies were sold in two years an uncommon example he asserts of the prevalence of genius in opposition to so much recent enmity as milton's public conduct had excited <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that if milton's political and religious opinions and the manner in which he announced them had raised him many enemies they had procured him numerous friends who as all personal danger was passed away at the time of publication would be eager to procure the master work of a man whom they revered and whom they would be proud of praising <\s>

<s> nine years before the death of shakspeare milton was born and early in life he published several small poems which though on their first appearance they were praised by a few of the judicious were afterwards neglected to that degree that pope in his youth could borrow from them without risk of its being known <\s>

<s> thirteen hundred copies were sold in two years an uncommon example he asserts of the prevalence of genius in opposition to so much recent enmity as milton's public conduct had excited <\s>

<s> what further demand there might be for these works i do not know but i well remember that twenty five years ago the booksellers stalls in london swarmed with the folios of cowley <\s>
<s> this is not mentioned in disparagement of that able writer and amiable man but merely to show that if milton's work were not more read it was not because readers did not exist at the time <\s>
<s> the early editions of the paradise lost were printed in a shape which allowed them to be sold at a low price yet only three thousand copies of the work were sold in eleven years and the nation says dr <\s>
<s> johnson had been satisfied from 1623 to 1664 that is forty one years with only two editions of the works of shakspeare which probably did not together make one thousand copies facts adduced by the critic to prove the paucity of readers there were readers in multitudes but their money went for other purposes as their admiration was fixed elsewhere <\s>
<s> we are authorized then to affirm that the reception of the paradise lost and the slow progress of its fame are proofs as striking as can be desired that the positions which i am attempting to establish are not erroneous 12 how amusing to shape to one's self such a critique as a wit of charles's days or a lord of the miscellanies or trading journalist of king william's time would have brought forth if he had set his faculties industriously to work upon this poem every where impregnated with original excellence <\s>

<s> to such his manly classical spirit could not readily commend itself till after a more attentive perusal they had got the better of their prejudices and either acquired or affected a truer taste <\s>
<s> a few others stood aloof merely because they had long before fixed the articles of their poetical creed and resigned themselves to an absolute despair of ever seeing any thing new and original <\s>
<s> these were somewhat mortified to find their notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet who seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own genius <\s>
<s> but in a short time the applause became unanimous every one wondering how so many pictures and pictures so familiar should have moved them but faintly to what they felt in his descriptions <\s>
<s> his digressions too the overflowings of a tender benevolent heart charmed the reader no less leaving him in doubt whether he should more admire the poet or love the man <\s>
<s> this case appears to bear strongly against us but we must distinguish between wonder and legitimate admiration <\s>
<s> the subject of the work is the changes produced in the appearances of nature by the revolution of the year and by undertaking to write in verse thomson pledged himself to treat his subject as became a poet <\s>
<s> now it is remarkable that excepting the nocturnal reverie of lady winchilsea and a passage or two in the windsor forest of pope the poetry of the period intervening between the publication of the paradise lost and the seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature and scarcely presents a familiar one from which it can be inferred that the eye of the poet had been steadily fixed upon his object much less that his feelings had urged him to work upon it in the spirit of genuine imagination <\s>
<s> to what a low state knowledge of the most obvious and important phenomena had sunk is evident from the style in which dryden has executed a description of night in one of his tragedies and pope his translation of the celebrated moonlight scene in the iliad <\s>

<s> the verses of dryden once highly celebrated are forgotten those of pope still retain their hold upon public estimation nay there is not a passage of descriptive poetry which at this day finds so many and such ardent admirers <\s>

<s> neither individuals nor nations become corrupt all at once nor are they enlightened in a moment <\s>
<s> thomson was an inspired poet but he could not work miracles in cases where the art of seeing had in some degree been learned the teacher would further the proficiency of his pupils but he could do little more though so far does vanity assist men in acts of self deception that many would often fancy they recognised a likeness when they knew nothing of the original <\s>
<s> having shown that much of what his biographer deemed genuine admiration must in fact have been blind wonderment how is the rest to be accounted for thomson was fortunate in the very title of his poem which seemed to bring it home to the prepared sympathies of every one in the next place notwithstanding his high powers he writes a vicious style and his false ornaments are exactly of that kind which would be most likely to strike the undiscerning <\s>
<s> he likewise abounds with sentimental common places that from the manner in which they were brought forward bore an imposing air of novelty <\s>
<s> in any well used copy of the seasons the book generally opens of itself with the rhapsody on love or with one of the stories perhaps damon and musidora ); these also are prominent in our collections of extracts and are the parts of his work which after all were probably most efficient in first recommending the author to general notice <\s>
<s> pope repaying praises which he had received and wishing to extol him to the highest only styles him an elegant and philosophical poet nor are we able to collect any unquestionable proofs that the true characteristics of thomson's genius as an imaginative poet 15 were perceived till the elder warton almost forty years after the publication of the seasons pointed them out by a note in his essay on the life and writings of pope <\s>
<s> in the castle of indolence of which gray speaks so coldly these characteristics were almost as conspicuously displayed and in verse more harmonious and diction more pure <\s>
<s> yet that fine poem was neglected on its appearance and is at this day the delight only of a few <\s>
<s> 15 since these observations upon thomson were written i have perused the second edition of his seasons and find that even that does not contain the most striking passages which warton points out for admiration these with other improvements throughout the whole work must have been added at a later period <\s>
<s> when thomson died collins breathed forth his regrets in an elegiac poem in which he pronounces a poetical curse upon him who should regard with insensibility the place where the poet's remains were deposited <\s>
<s> the poems of the mourner himself have now passed through innumerable editions and are universally known but if when collins died the same kind of imprecation had been pronounced by a surviving admirer small is the number whom it would not have comprehended <\s>
<s> the notice which his poems attained during his life time was so small and of course the sale so insignificant that not long before his death he deemed it right to repay to the bookseller the sum which he had advanced for them and threw the edition into the fire <\s>
<s> the name of spenser whose genius is of a higher order than even that of ariosto is at this day scarcely known beyond the limits of the british isles <\s>
<s> and if the value of his works is to be estimated from the attention now paid to them by his countrymen compared with that which they bestow on those of some other writers it must be pronounced small indeed <\s>
<s> the laurel meed of mighty conquerors and poets sage are his own words but his wisdom has in this particular been his worst enemy while its opposite whether in the shape of folly or madness has been their best friend <\s>
<s> but he was a great power and bears a high name the laurel has been awarded to him <\s>
<s> a dramatic author if he write for the stage must adapt himself to the taste of the audience or they will not endure him accordingly the mighty genius of shakspeare was listened to <\s>
<s> the people were delighted but i am not sufficiently versed in stage antiquities to determine whether they did not flock as eagerly to the representation of many pieces of contemporary authors wholly undeserving to appear upon the same boards <\s>
<s> had there been a formal contest for superiority among dramatic writers that shakspeare like his predecessors sophocles and euripides would have often been subject to the mortification of seeing the prize adjudged to sorry competitors becomes too probable when we reflect that the admirers of settle and shadwell were in a later age as numerous and reckoned as respectable in point of talent as those of dryden <\s>
<s> at all events that shakspeare stooped to accommodate himself to the people is sufficiently apparent and one of the most striking proofs of his almost omnipotent genius is that he could turn to such glorious purpose those materials which the prepossessions of the age compelled him to make use of <\s>
<s> yet even this marvellous skill appears not to have been enough to prevent his rivals from having some advantage over him in public estimation else how can we account for passages and scenes that exist in his works unless upon a supposition that some of the grossest of them a fact which in my own mind i have no doubt of were foisted in by the players for the gratification of the many <\s>
<s> but that his works whatever might be their reception upon the stage made but little impression upon the ruling intellects of the time may be inferred from the fact that lord bacon in his multifarious writings nowhere either quotes or alludes to him 10 his dramatic excellence enabled him to resume possession of the stage after the restoration but dryden tells us that in his time two of the plays of beaumont and fletcher were acted for one of shakspeare's <\s>
<s> and so faint and limited was the perception of the poetic beauties of his dramas in the time of pope that in his edition of the plays with a view of rendering to the general reader a necessary service he printed between inverted commas those passages which he thought most worthy of notice <\s>
<s> 10 the learned hakewill a third edition of whose book bears date 1635 writing to refute the error touching nature's perpetual and universal decay cites triumphantly the names of ariosto tasso bartas and spenser as instances that poetic genius had not degenerated but he makes no mention of shakspeare <\s>
<s> at this day the french critics have abated nothing of their aversion to this darling of our nation the english with their bouffon de shakspeare is as familiar an expression among them as in the time of voltaire <\s>
<s> baron grimm is the only french writer who seems to have perceived his infinite superiority to the first names of the french theatre an advantage which the parisian critic owed to his german blood and german education <\s>
<s> the most enlightened italians though well acquainted with our language are wholly incompetent to measure the proportions of shakspeare <\s>
<s> the germans only of foreign nations are approaching towards a knowledge and feeling of what he is <\s>
<s> in some respects they have acquired a superiority over the fellow countrymen of the poet for among us it is a current i might say an established opinion that shakspeare is justly praised when he is pronounced to be a wild irregular genius in whom great faults are compensated by great beauties <\s>
<s> how long may it be before this misconception passes away and it becomes universally acknowledged that the judgment of shakspeare in the selection of his materials and in the manner in which he has made them heterogeneous as they often are constitute a unity of their own and contribute all to one great end is not less admirable than his imagination his invention and his intuitive knowledge of human nature <\s>
<s> there is extant a small volume of miscellaneous poems in which shakspeare expresses his own feelings in his own person <\s>
<s> it is not difficult to conceive that the editor george steevens should have been insensible to the beauties of one portion of that volume the sonnets though in no part of the writings of this poet is found in an equal compass a greater number of exquisite feelings felicitously expressed <\s>
<s> but from regard to the critic's own credit he would not have ventured to talk of an 11 act of parliament not being strong enough to compel the perusal of those little pieces if he had not known that the people of england were ignorant of the treasures contained in them and if he had not moreover shared the too common propensity of human nature to exult over a supposed fall into the mire of a genius whom he had been compelled to regard with admiration as an inmate of the celestial regions 'there sitting where he durst not soar <\s>
