<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>

<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>

<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>

<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>
<s> 54 a squirrel so i have heard the old people of wytheburn say might have gone from their chapel to keswick without alighting on the ground <\s>
<s> the want most felt however is that of timber trees <\s>
<s> there are few magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes and unless greater care be taken there will in a short time scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling <\s>
<s> the neighbourhood of rydal notwithstanding the havoc which has been made is yet nobly distinguished <\s>
<s> in the woods of lowther also is found an almost matchless store of ancient trees and the majesty and wildness of the native forest <\s>
<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>

<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>

<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>

<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>
<s> 54 a squirrel so i have heard the old people of wytheburn say might have gone from their chapel to keswick without alighting on the ground <\s>
<s> the want most felt however is that of timber trees <\s>
<s> there are few magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes and unless greater care be taken there will in a short time scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling <\s>
<s> the neighbourhood of rydal notwithstanding the havoc which has been made is yet nobly distinguished <\s>
<s> in the woods of lowther also is found an almost matchless store of ancient trees and the majesty and wildness of the native forest <\s>
<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>

<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>

<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>
<s> 54 a squirrel so i have heard the old people of wytheburn say might have gone from their chapel to keswick without alighting on the ground <\s>
<s> the want most felt however is that of timber trees <\s>
<s> there are few magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes and unless greater care be taken there will in a short time scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling <\s>
<s> the neighbourhood of rydal notwithstanding the havoc which has been made is yet nobly distinguished <\s>
<s> in the woods of lowther also is found an almost matchless store of ancient trees and the majesty and wildness of the native forest <\s>
<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>

<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>

<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>

<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>

<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>

<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>

<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>
<s> 54 a squirrel so i have heard the old people of wytheburn say might have gone from their chapel to keswick without alighting on the ground <\s>
<s> the want most felt however is that of timber trees <\s>
<s> there are few magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes and unless greater care be taken there will in a short time scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling <\s>
<s> the neighbourhood of rydal notwithstanding the havoc which has been made is yet nobly distinguished <\s>
<s> in the woods of lowther also is found an almost matchless store of ancient trees and the majesty and wildness of the native forest <\s>
<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>

<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>

<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>

<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>
<s> 54 a squirrel so i have heard the old people of wytheburn say might have gone from their chapel to keswick without alighting on the ground <\s>
<s> the want most felt however is that of timber trees <\s>
<s> there are few magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes and unless greater care be taken there will in a short time scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling <\s>
<s> the neighbourhood of rydal notwithstanding the havoc which has been made is yet nobly distinguished <\s>
<s> in the woods of lowther also is found an almost matchless store of ancient trees and the majesty and wildness of the native forest <\s>
<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>

<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>

<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>
<s> 54 a squirrel so i have heard the old people of wytheburn say might have gone from their chapel to keswick without alighting on the ground <\s>
<s> the want most felt however is that of timber trees <\s>
<s> there are few magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes and unless greater care be taken there will in a short time scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling <\s>
<s> the neighbourhood of rydal notwithstanding the havoc which has been made is yet nobly distinguished <\s>
<s> in the woods of lowther also is found an almost matchless store of ancient trees and the majesty and wildness of the native forest <\s>
<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>

<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>

<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>

<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>

<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>

<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>

<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>
<s> 54 a squirrel so i have heard the old people of wytheburn say might have gone from their chapel to keswick without alighting on the ground <\s>
<s> the want most felt however is that of timber trees <\s>
<s> there are few magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes and unless greater care be taken there will in a short time scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling <\s>
<s> the neighbourhood of rydal notwithstanding the havoc which has been made is yet nobly distinguished <\s>
<s> in the woods of lowther also is found an almost matchless store of ancient trees and the majesty and wildness of the native forest <\s>
<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
<s> a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable <\s>
<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>

<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>

<s> the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element <\s>
<s> the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillity not a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptible except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensible or it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the world yet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject <\s>
<s> thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense <\s>
<s> we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night <\s>
<s> milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself <\s>
<s> in the night season also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart <\s>
<s> the stars taking their stations above the hill tops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter <\s>
<s> a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt <\s>
<s> nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance <\s>
<s> these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country <\s>
<s> the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a night scene suggested by the vale of keswick <\s>
<s> the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country <\s>
<s> now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night rode in her zenith not a passing breeze sigh'd to the grove which in the midnight air stood motionless and in the peaceful floods inverted hung for now the billows slept along the shore nor heav'd the deep but spread a shining mirror to the moon's pale orb which dim and waning o'er the shadowy cliffs the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops her glimmering faintness threw now every eye oppress'd with toil was drown'd in deep repose save that the unseen shepherd in his watch propp'd on his crook stood listening by the fold and gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene but the soft murmur of swift gushing rills forth issuing from the mountain's distant steep unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaim'd all things at rest and imag'd the still voice of quiet whispering in the ear of night 55 55 dr <\s>
<s> brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey <\s>
<s> it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses <\s>
<s> tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born <\s>
<s> but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first <\s>
<s> progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious <\s>
<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>

<s> aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants <\s>
<s> masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood <\s>
<s> the smallest rivulet one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake will be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed <\s>
<s> but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gently sloping surfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised <\s>
<s> these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up <\s>
<s> but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gently sloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains <\s>
<s> among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the setting in of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of water lilies lifting up their large target shaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave <\s>
<s> to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters <\s>
<s> wild ducks in spring time hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shores the sand piper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless upon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance <\s>
<s> in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species <\s>
<s> let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter <\s>
<s> mark how the feather'd tenants of the flood with grace of motion that might scarcely seem inferior to angelical prolong their curious pastime <\s>
<s> shaping in mid air and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars high as the level of the mountain tops a circuit ampler than the lake beneath their own domain but ever while intent on tracing and retracing that large round their jubilant activity evolves hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro upward and downward progress intricate yet unperplex'd as if one spirit swayed their indefatigable flight tis done ten times or more i fancied it had ceased but lo <\s>
<s> the vanish'd company again ascending they approach i hear their wings faint faint at first and then an eager sound past in a moment and as faint again <\s>
<s> they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes they tempt the water or the gleaming ice to shew them a fair image tis themselves their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain painted more soft and fair as they descend almost to touch then up again aloft up with a sally and a flash of speed as if they scorn'd both resting place and rest <\s>
<s> the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices <\s>
<s> every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapel holm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st <\s>
<s> the islands of the last mentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape <\s>
<s> there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten <\s>
<s> in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is the haunt of cormorants and sea mews clang a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes <\s>
<s> it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwent water and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> fas habeas invisere tiburis arva albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes 51 51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor <\s>
<s> this part of the subject may be concluded with observing that from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries <\s>
<s> the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwent water similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one <\s>
<s> having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns <\s>
<s> in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation <\s>
<s> but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain <\s>
<s> tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains <\s>
<s> a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area <\s>
<s> accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess <\s>
<s> of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example <\s>
<s> it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of water lilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible <\s>
<s> five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain <\s>
<s> the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare <\s>
<s> they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting <\s>
<s> at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred <\s>
<s> some few have a varied outline with bold heath clad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on high the contribution of ages <\s>
<s> a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes <\s>
<s> nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance <\s>
<s> water fowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices <\s>
<s> there sometimes does a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer the crags repeat the raven's croak in symphony austere thither the rainbow comes the cloud and mists that spread the flying shroud and sunbeams and the sounding blast <\s>
<s> it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and back ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur <\s>
<s> but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water 52 ]; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water <\s>
<s> nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty <\s>
<s> in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lake country are rather large brooks than rivers <\s>
<s> the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country <\s>
<s> the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and water breaks and they need not here be described <\s>
<s> i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings <\s>
<s> 52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best <\s>
<s> the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast <\s>
<s> from whitehaven to st <\s>
<s> bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea <\s>
<s> the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wych elm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks <\s>
<s> formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs 53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day <\s>
<s> but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan 54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppice woods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the forest trees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains <\s>
<s> the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce <\s>
<s> other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c <\s>
<s> and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds <\s>
<s> 53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries <\s>
<s> 54 a squirrel so i have heard the old people of wytheburn say might have gone from their chapel to keswick without alighting on the ground <\s>
<s> the want most felt however is that of timber trees <\s>
<s> there are few magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes and unless greater care be taken there will in a short time scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling <\s>
<s> the neighbourhood of rydal notwithstanding the havoc which has been made is yet nobly distinguished <\s>
<s> in the woods of lowther also is found an almost matchless store of ancient trees and the majesty and wildness of the native forest <\s>
<s> among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tomb stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fields the broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms and the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains the dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear <\s>
<s> nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen <\s>
<s> it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate <\s>
<s> the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great <\s>
<s> nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland <\s>
<s> the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields <\s>
<s> days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear <\s>
<s> vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun rise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors <\s>
<s> akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill tops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature <\s>
<s> how pregnant with imagination for the poet <\s>
<s> and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments <\s>
<s> such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledge will often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle <\s>
<s> the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance a sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable <\s>
<s> it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages <\s>
<s> in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole months i might say even years <\s>
<s> one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring time when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new born verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden age to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of lethe to the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations <\s>
<s> but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervene the atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments <\s>
