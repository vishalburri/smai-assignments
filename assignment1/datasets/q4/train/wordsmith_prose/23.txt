<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>

<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>

<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>

<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>

<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>

<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>

<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>

<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>

<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>

<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>

<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>

<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>

<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>

<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>

<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>

<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>

<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>

<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>

<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>

<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>

<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>

<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>

<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>

<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>

<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>

<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>

<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>

<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>

<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>

<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>

<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>

<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>

<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>

<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>

<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>

<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>

<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>

<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>

<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>

<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>

<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>

<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>

<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>

<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>

<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>

<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>

<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>

<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>

<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>

<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>

<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>

<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>

<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>

<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>

<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>

<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>

<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>

<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>

<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>

<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>

<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>

<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>

<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>

<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>

<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>

<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>

<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>

<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>

<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>

<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>

<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>

<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>

<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>

<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>

<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>

<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>

<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>

<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>

<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>

<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>

<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>

<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>

<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>

<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>

<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>

<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>

<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>

<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>

<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>

<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>

<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>

<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>

<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>

<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>

<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>

<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>

<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>

<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>

<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>

<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>

<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>

<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>

<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>

<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative <\s>
<s> there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itself a life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher <\s>
<s> nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i say for to such i shall confine myself independent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it <\s>
<s> for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind <\s>
<s> let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated <\s>
<s> or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i <\s>
<s> was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him <\s>
<s> then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power <\s>
<s> then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination <\s>
<s> every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards <\s>
<s> above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit <\s>
<s> there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times <\s>
<s> one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away <\s>
<s> ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller 26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants <\s>
<s> it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount <\s>
<s> he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants <\s>
<s> but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from others that of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountain top while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below <\s>
<s> the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished <\s>
<s> we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry <\s>
<s> what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors <\s>
<s> the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it <\s>
<s> 26 see ashe's travels in america <\s>
<s> these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far <\s>
<s> for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded <\s>
<s> deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed <\s>
<s> and first for the heart cheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection <\s>
<s> if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth <\s>
<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>
<s> such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them <\s>
<s> but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race <\s>
<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>
<s> the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line <\s>
<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>

<s> in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history <\s>

<s> let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatly gifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable <\s>

<s> it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison <\s>
<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>

<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>

<s> it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress <\s>
<s> but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual <\s>
<s> but human kind what is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality <\s>
<s> a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with rage they that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury <\s>
<s> it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken <\s>
<s> happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition <\s>
<s> yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited <\s>
<s> may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species <\s>
<s> the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurling back of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude <\s>
<s> if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind <\s>
<s> but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondent's letter <\s>
<s> protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and high minded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and self originating effort and upon the practice of self examination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced <\s>
<s> but how is this to be expected from youth <\s>
<s> is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds <\s>
<s> to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous <\s>
<s> yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life <\s>
<s> for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power <\s>
<s> the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes <\s>
<s> if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises <\s>
<s> hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable <\s>
<s> in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow <\s>
<s> am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired <\s>
<s> in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes <\s>
<s> or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others <\s>
<s> am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankind that a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them <\s>
<s> have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyes has no haze bedimmed it <\s>
<s> has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging <\s>
<s> knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that pre eminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men <\s>
<s> do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birth right as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me <\s>
<s> this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules <\s>
<s> here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss self satisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive <\s>
<s> the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate <\s>
<s> the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates <\s>
<s> the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of fame a late though lasting consequence <\s>
<s> of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh <\s>
<s> the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion <\s>
<s> i spoke of a few simple questions <\s>
<s> the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind <\s>
<s> we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation <\s>
<s> are we then to despond to retire from all contest and to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many <\s>
<s> but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic <\s>
<s> we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised <\s>
<s> if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure <\s>
<s> but what can he gain from this admonition <\s>
<s> he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind <\s>
<s> granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance <\s>
<s> he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature <\s>
<s> a re union in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit <\s>
<s> we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dew drops of knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragrance of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters of images uncalled for and rising up like exhalations of hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living forehead in a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight <\s>
<s> we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhood overlooked or forgotten <\s>
<s> we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends <\s>
<s> a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced <\s>
<s> there never perhaps existed a school boy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell <\s>
<s> it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy minded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more <\s>
<s> this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding <\s>
<s> in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another <\s>
<s> let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself <\s>
<s> are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit <\s>
<s> surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve <\s>
<s> let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support <\s>
<s> a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself <\s>
<s> new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is self disregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden <\s>
<s> in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever <\s>
<s> hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws <\s>
<s> these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose <\s>
<s> a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action <\s>
<s> the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think 27 27 the friend vol <\s>
