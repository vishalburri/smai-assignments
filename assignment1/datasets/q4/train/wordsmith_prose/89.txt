<s> milton talks of pouring easy his unpremeditated verse <\s>
<s> it would be harsh untrue and odious to say there is anything like cant in this but it is not true to the letter and tends to mislead <\s>
<s> i could point out to you five hundred passages in milton upon which labour has been bestowed and twice five hundred more to which additional labour would have been serviceable <\s>
<s> not that i regret the absence of such labour because no poem contains more proofs of skill acquired by practice <\s>
<s> these observations are not called out by any defects or imperfections in your last pieces especially they are equal to the former ones in effect have many beauties and are not inferior in execution but again i do venture to submit to your consideration whether the poetical parts of your nature would not find a field more favourable to their exercise in the regions of prose not because those regions are humbler but because they may be gracefully and profitably trod with footsteps less careful and in measures less elaborate <\s>
<s> and now i have done with the subject and have only to add that when you write verses you would not fail from time to time to let me have a sight of them provided you will allow me to defer criticism on your diction and versification till we meet <\s>
<s> my eyes are so often useless both for reading and writing that i cannot tax the eyes and pens of others with writing down observations which to indifferent persons must be tedious <\s>
<s> upon the whole i am not sorry that your project of going to london at present is dropped <\s>
<s> it would have grieved me had you been unfurnished with an introduction from me to mr <\s>
<s> coleridge yet i know not how i could have given you one he is often so very unwell <\s>

<s> shakspeare's sonnets excuse this leap are not upon the italian model which milton's are they are merely quatrains with a couplet tacked to the end and if they depended much upon the versification they would unavoidably be heavy <\s>
<s> one word upon reform in parliament a subject to which somewhat reluctantly you allude <\s>
<s> you are a reformer <\s>

<s> milton talks of pouring easy his unpremeditated verse <\s>
<s> it would be harsh untrue and odious to say there is anything like cant in this but it is not true to the letter and tends to mislead <\s>
<s> i could point out to you five hundred passages in milton upon which labour has been bestowed and twice five hundred more to which additional labour would have been serviceable <\s>
<s> not that i regret the absence of such labour because no poem contains more proofs of skill acquired by practice <\s>
<s> these observations are not called out by any defects or imperfections in your last pieces especially they are equal to the former ones in effect have many beauties and are not inferior in execution but again i do venture to submit to your consideration whether the poetical parts of your nature would not find a field more favourable to their exercise in the regions of prose not because those regions are humbler but because they may be gracefully and profitably trod with footsteps less careful and in measures less elaborate <\s>
<s> and now i have done with the subject and have only to add that when you write verses you would not fail from time to time to let me have a sight of them provided you will allow me to defer criticism on your diction and versification till we meet <\s>
<s> my eyes are so often useless both for reading and writing that i cannot tax the eyes and pens of others with writing down observations which to indifferent persons must be tedious <\s>
<s> upon the whole i am not sorry that your project of going to london at present is dropped <\s>
<s> it would have grieved me had you been unfurnished with an introduction from me to mr <\s>
<s> coleridge yet i know not how i could have given you one he is often so very unwell <\s>

<s> shakspeare's sonnets excuse this leap are not upon the italian model which milton's are they are merely quatrains with a couplet tacked to the end and if they depended much upon the versification they would unavoidably be heavy <\s>
<s> one word upon reform in parliament a subject to which somewhat reluctantly you allude <\s>
<s> you are a reformer <\s>

<s> milton talks of pouring easy his unpremeditated verse <\s>
<s> it would be harsh untrue and odious to say there is anything like cant in this but it is not true to the letter and tends to mislead <\s>
<s> i could point out to you five hundred passages in milton upon which labour has been bestowed and twice five hundred more to which additional labour would have been serviceable <\s>
<s> not that i regret the absence of such labour because no poem contains more proofs of skill acquired by practice <\s>
<s> these observations are not called out by any defects or imperfections in your last pieces especially they are equal to the former ones in effect have many beauties and are not inferior in execution but again i do venture to submit to your consideration whether the poetical parts of your nature would not find a field more favourable to their exercise in the regions of prose not because those regions are humbler but because they may be gracefully and profitably trod with footsteps less careful and in measures less elaborate <\s>
<s> and now i have done with the subject and have only to add that when you write verses you would not fail from time to time to let me have a sight of them provided you will allow me to defer criticism on your diction and versification till we meet <\s>
<s> my eyes are so often useless both for reading and writing that i cannot tax the eyes and pens of others with writing down observations which to indifferent persons must be tedious <\s>
<s> upon the whole i am not sorry that your project of going to london at present is dropped <\s>
<s> it would have grieved me had you been unfurnished with an introduction from me to mr <\s>
<s> coleridge yet i know not how i could have given you one he is often so very unwell <\s>

<s> shakspeare's sonnets excuse this leap are not upon the italian model which milton's are they are merely quatrains with a couplet tacked to the end and if they depended much upon the versification they would unavoidably be heavy <\s>
<s> one word upon reform in parliament a subject to which somewhat reluctantly you allude <\s>
<s> you are a reformer <\s>

<s> as to the cholera i cannot say it appals me much it may be in the order of providence to employ this scourge for bringing the nation to its senses though history tells us in the case of the plague at athens and other like visitations that men are never so wicked and depraved as when afflictions of that kind are upon them <\s>

<s> my daughter was with me <\s>
<s> we arrived at his house on monday noon and left it at the same time on thursday the very day before he quitted abbotsford for london on his way to naples <\s>
<s> on the morning of our departure he composed a few lines for dora's album and wrote them in it <\s>
<s> we prize this memorial very much and the more so as an affecting testimony of his regard at a time when as the verses prove his health of body and powers of mind were much impaired and shaken <\s>
<s> you will recollect the little green book which you were kind enough to write in on its first page <\s>
<s> let me hope that your health will improve so that you may be enabled to proceed with the sacred poetry with which you are engaged <\s>

<s> my dear sir you have imputed my silence i trust to some cause neither disagreeable to yourself nor unworthy of me <\s>
<s> your letter of the 26th of nov <\s>
<s> had been misdirected to penrith where the postmaster detained it some time expecting probably that i should come to that place which i have often occasion to visit <\s>
<s> when it reached me i was engaged in assisting my wife to make out some of my mangled and almost illegible mss which inevitably involved me in endeavours to correct and improve them <\s>
<s> my eyes are subject to frequent inflammations of which i had an attack and am still suffering from it while that was going on <\s>
<s> you would nevertheless have heard from me almost as soon as i received your letter could i have replied to it in terms in any degree accordant to my wishes <\s>
<s> your exhortations troubled me in a way you cannot be in the least aware of for i have been repeatedly urged by some of my most valued friends and at times by my own conscience to undertake the task you have set before me <\s>
<s> but i will deal frankly with you <\s>
<s> a conviction of my incompetence to do justice to the momentous subject has kept me and i fear will keep me silent <\s>
<s> my sixty second year will soon be completed and though i have been favoured thus far in health and strength beyond most men of my age yet i feel its effects upon my spirits they sink under a pressure of apprehension to which at an earlier period of my life they would probably have been superior <\s>
<s> there is yet another obstacle i am no ready master of prose writing having been little practised in the art <\s>
<s> this last consideration will not weigh with you nor would it have done with myself a few years ago but the bare mention of it will serve to show that years have deprived me of courage in the sense the word bears when applied by chaucer to the animation of birds in spring time <\s>
<s> what i have already said precludes the necessity of otherwise confirming your assumption that i am opposed to the spirit you so justly characterise 122 to your opinions upon this subject my judgment if i may borrow your own word responds <\s>
<s> providence is now trying this empire through her political institutions <\s>
<s> sound minds find their expediency in principles unsound their principles in expediency <\s>
<s> on the proportion of these minds to each other the issue depends <\s>
<s> from calculations of partial expediency in opposition to general principles whether those calculations be governed by fear or presumption nothing but mischief is to be looked for but in the present stage of our affairs the class that does the most harm consists of well intentioned men who being ignorant of human nature think that they may help the thorough paced reformers and revolutionists to a certain point then stop and that the machine will stop with them <\s>
<s> after all the question is fundamentally one of piety and morals of piety as disposing men who are anxious for social improvement to wait patiently for god's good time and of morals as guarding them from doing evil that good may come or thinking that any ends can be so good as to justify wrong means for attaining them <\s>
<s> in fact means in the concerns of this life are infinitely more important than ends which are to be valued mainly according to the qualities and virtues requisite for their attainment and the best test of an end being good is the purity of the means which by the laws of god and our nature must be employed in order to secure it <\s>
<s> even the interests of eternity become distorted the moment they are looked at through the medium of impure means <\s>
<s> scarcely had i written this when i was told by a person in the treasury that it is intended to carry the reform bill by a new creation of peers <\s>
<s> if this be done the constitution of england will be destroyed and the present lord chancellor after having contributed to murder it may consistently enough pronounce in his place its ?? loge funèbre <\s>
<s> i turn with pleasure to the sonnets you have addressed to me and if i did not read them with unqualified satisfaction it was only from consciousness that i was unworthy of the enconiums they bestowed upon me <\s>
<s> among the papers i have lately been arranging are passages that would prove as forcibly as anything of mine that has been published you were not mistaken in your supposition that it is the habit of my mind inseparably to connect loftiness of imagination with that humility of mind which is best taught in scripture <\s>
<s> hoping that you will be indulgent to my silence which has been from various causes protracted contrary to my wish believe me to be dear sir very faithfully yours wm <\s>

<s> of poetry and prose milton and shakspeare reform c letter to professor hamilton dublin <\s>
<s> hamilton you send me showers of verses which i receive with much pleasure as do we all yet have we fears that this employment may seduce you from the path of science which you seem destined to tread with so much honour to yourself and profit to others <\s>
<s> again and again i must repeat that the composition of verse is infinitely more of an art than men are prepared to believe and absolute success in it depends upon innumerable minutiae which it grieves me you should stoop to acquire a knowledge of <\s>
<s> milton talks of pouring easy his unpremeditated verse <\s>
<s> it would be harsh untrue and odious to say there is anything like cant in this but it is not true to the letter and tends to mislead <\s>
<s> i could point out to you five hundred passages in milton upon which labour has been bestowed and twice five hundred more to which additional labour would have been serviceable <\s>
<s> not that i regret the absence of such labour because no poem contains more proofs of skill acquired by practice <\s>
<s> these observations are not called out by any defects or imperfections in your last pieces especially they are equal to the former ones in effect have many beauties and are not inferior in execution but again i do venture to submit to your consideration whether the poetical parts of your nature would not find a field more favourable to their exercise in the regions of prose not because those regions are humbler but because they may be gracefully and profitably trod with footsteps less careful and in measures less elaborate <\s>
<s> and now i have done with the subject and have only to add that when you write verses you would not fail from time to time to let me have a sight of them provided you will allow me to defer criticism on your diction and versification till we meet <\s>
<s> my eyes are so often useless both for reading and writing that i cannot tax the eyes and pens of others with writing down observations which to indifferent persons must be tedious <\s>
<s> upon the whole i am not sorry that your project of going to london at present is dropped <\s>
<s> it would have grieved me had you been unfurnished with an introduction from me to mr <\s>
<s> coleridge yet i know not how i could have given you one he is often so very unwell <\s>
<s> a few weeks ago he had had two attacks of cholera and appears to be so much broken down that unless i were assured he was something in his better way i could not disturb him by the introduction of any one <\s>
<s> his most intimate friend is mr <\s>
<s> green a man of science and a distinguished surgeon <\s>
<s> if to him you could procure an introduction he would let you know the state of coleridge's health and to mr <\s>
<s> green whom i once saw you might use my name with a view to further your wish if it were at all needful <\s>
<s> shakspeare's sonnets excuse this leap are not upon the italian model which milton's are they are merely quatrains with a couplet tacked to the end and if they depended much upon the versification they would unavoidably be heavy <\s>
<s> one word upon reform in parliament a subject to which somewhat reluctantly you allude <\s>
<s> you are a reformer <\s>
<s> are you an approver of the bill as rejected by the lords <\s>
<s> or to use lord grey's words anything as efficient he means if he means anything for producing change <\s>
<s> then i earnestly entreat you to devote hours and hours to the study of human nature in books in life and in your own mind and beg and pray that you would mix with society not in ireland and scotland only but in england a fount of destiny which if once poisoned away goes all hope of quiet progress in well doing <\s>
<s> the constitution of england which seems about to be destroyed offers to my mind the sublimest contemplation which the history of society and government have ever presented to it and for this cause especially that its principles have the character of preconceived ideas archetypes of the pure intellect while they are in fact the results of a humble minded experience <\s>

<s> my lord if after all i should be asked how i would myself vote if it had been my fortune to have a seat in the house of lords i must say that i should oppose the second reading though with my eyes open to the great hazard of doing so <\s>
<s> my support however would be found in standing by a great principle for without being unbecomingly personal i may state to your lordship that it has ever been the habit of my mind to trust that expediency will come out of fidelity to principles rather than to seek my principles of action in calculations of expediency <\s>

<s> you were not mistaken in supposing that the state of public affairs has troubled me much <\s>
<s> i cannot see how the government is to be carried on but by such sacrifices to the democracy as will sooner or later upset everything <\s>
<s> whoever governs it will be by out bidding for popular favour those who went before them <\s>
<s> sir robert peel was obliged to give way in his government to the spirit of reform as it is falsely called these men are going beyond him and if ever he shall come back it will only i fear be to carry on the movement in a shape somewhat less objectionable than it will take from the whigs <\s>
<s> in the mean while the radicals or republicans are cunningly content to have this work done ostensibly by the whigs while in fact they themselves are the whigs masters as the whigs well know but they hope to be preserved from destruction by throwing themselves back upon the tories when measures shall be urged upon them by their masters which they may think too desperate <\s>
<s> what i am most afraid of is alterations in the constituency and in the duration of parliament which will bring it more and more under the dominion of the lower and lowest classes <\s>
