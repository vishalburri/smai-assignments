<s> at noon on thursday we left abbotsford and on the morning of that day sir walter and i had a serious conversation tête ?tête when he spoke with gratitude of the happy life which upon the whole he had led <\s>

<s> in this interview also it was that upon my expressing a hope of his health being benefited by the climate of the country to which he was going and by the interest he would take in the classic remembrances of italy he made use of the quotation from yarrow revisited as recorded by me in the musings at aquapendente six years afterwards <\s>

<s> iv the manses in scotland and the gardens and grounds about them have seldom that attractive appearance which is common about our english parsonages even when the clergyman's income falls below the average of the scotch minister's <\s>
<s> this is not merely owing to the one country being poor in comparison with the other but arises rather out of the equality of their benefices so that no one has enough to spare for decorations that might serve as an example for others whereas with us the taste of the richer incumbent extends its influence more or less to the poorest <\s>
