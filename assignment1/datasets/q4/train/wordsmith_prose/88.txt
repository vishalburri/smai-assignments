<s> there is a great deal of intellectual activity within the walls of this college and in the university at large but conversation turns mainly upon the state of the country and the late change in the administration <\s>
<s> the fires have extended to within 8 miles of this place from which i saw one of the worst if not absolutely the worst indicated by a redness in the sky a few nights ago <\s>
<s> i am glad when i fall in with a member of parliament as it puts me upon writing to my friends which i am always disposed to defer without such a determining advantage <\s>
<s> at present we have two members mr <\s>

<s> we have also here lady blanche wife of mr <\s>
<s> cavendish and sister of lord morpeth <\s>
<s> she is a great admirer of mrs <\s>
<s> there is an interesting person in this university for a day or two whom i have not yet seen kenelm digby author of the broadstone of honor a book of chivalry which i think was put into your hands at rydal mount <\s>
<s> we have also a respectable show of blossom in poetry <\s>
<s> two brothers of the name of tennison in particular are not a little promising <\s>
<s> of science i can give you no account though perhaps i may pick up something for a future letter which may be long in coming for reasons before mentioned <\s>
<s> and my daughter of whom you inquire are both well the latter rides as often as weather and regard for the age of her pony will allow <\s>
<s> she has resumed her german labours and is not easily drawn from what she takes to <\s>
<s> therefore i hope miss hamilton will not find fault if she does not write for some time as she will readily conceive that with this passion upon her and many engagements she will be rather averse to writing <\s>
<s> in fact she owes a long letter to her brother in germany who by the bye tells us that he will not cease to look out for the book of kant you wished for <\s>

<s> in his opinion the ministers when they brought in the bill neither expected nor wished it to be carried <\s>
<s> all they wanted was an opportunity of saying to the people behold what great things we would have done for you had it been in our power we must now content ourselves with the best we can get <\s>
<s> but to return to your letter <\s>
<s> to speak frankly you appear to be at least three fourths gone in love therefore think about the last quarter in the journey <\s>
<s> the picture you give of the lady makes one wish to see her more familiarly than i had an opportunity of doing were it only to ascertain whether as you astronomers have in your observatories magnifying glasses for the stars you do not carry about with you also when you descend to common life coloured glasses and claude loraine mirrors for throwing upon objects that interest you enough for the purpose such lights and hues as may be most to the taste of the intellectual vision <\s>
<s> in a former letter you mention francis edgeworth <\s>
<s> he is a person not to be forgotten <\s>
<s> if you be in communication with him pray present him my very kind respects and say that he was not unfrequently in my thoughts during my late poetic rambles and particularly when i saw the objects which called forth a sonnet that i shall send you <\s>
<s> he was struck with my mention of a sound in the eagle's notes much and frequently resembling the yelping and barking of a dog and quoted a passage in eschylus where the eagle is called the flying hound of the air and he suggested that eschylus might not only allude by that term to his being a bird of chase or prey but also to this barking voice which i do not recollect ever hearing noticed <\s>
<s> the other day i was forcibly reminded of the circumstances under which the pair of eagles were seen that i described in the letter to mr <\s>
<s> it was the promontory of fairhead on the coast of antrim and no spectacle could be grander <\s>
<s> at dunally castle a ruin seated at the tip of one of the horns of the bay of oban i saw the other day one of these noble creatures cooped up among the ruins and was incited to give vent to my feelings as you shall now see dishonoured rock and ruin <\s>

<s> vexed is he and screams loud the last i saw was on the wing and struck my soul with awe now wheeling low then with a consort paired from a bold headland their loved aery's guard flying above atlantic waves to draw light from the fountain of the setting sun <\s>
<s> such was this prisoner once and when his plumes the sea blast ruffles as the storm comes on in spirit for a moment he resumes his rank mong free born creatures that live free his power his beauty and his majesty <\s>
<s> you will naturally wish to hear something of sir walter scott and particularly of his health <\s>
<s> i found him a good deal changed within the last three or four years in consequence of some shocks of the apoplectic kind but his friends say that he is very much better and the last accounts up to the time of his going on board were still more favourable <\s>
<s> he himself thinks his age much against him but he has only completed his 60th year <\s>
<s> but a friend of mine was here the other day who has rallied and is himself again after a much severer shock and at an age several years more advanced <\s>
<s> so that i trust the world and his friends may be hopeful with good reason that the life and faculties of this man who has during the last six and twenty years diffused more innocent pleasure than ever fell to the lot of any human being to do in his own life time may be spared <\s>
<s> voltaire no doubt was full as extensively known and filled a larger space probably in the eye of europe for he was a great theatrical writer which scott has not proved himself to be and miscellaneous to that degree that there was something for all classes of readers but the pleasure afforded by his writings with the exception of some of his tragedies and minor poems was not pure and in this scott is greatly his superior <\s>
<s> as dora has told your sister sir w <\s>
<s> was our guide to yarrow <\s>
<s> the pleasure of that day induced me to add a third to the two poems upon yarrow yarrow revisited <\s>
<s> it is in the same measure and as much in the same spirit as matter of fact would allow <\s>
<s> you are artist enough to know that it is next to impossible entirely to harmonise things that rest upon their poetic credibility and are idealised by distance of time and space with those that rest upon the evidence of the hour and have about them the thorny points of actual life <\s>
<s> i am interrupted by a stranger and a gleam of fine weather reminds me also of taking advantage of it the moment i am at liberty for we have had a week of incessant rain <\s>

<s> i set off with a severe inflammation in one of my eyes which was removed by being so much in the open air and for more than a month i scarcely saw a newspaper or heard of their contents <\s>
<s> during this time we almost forgot my daughter and i the deplorable state of the country <\s>
<s> my spirits rallied and with exercise for i often walked scarcely less than twenty miles a day and the employment of composing verses amid scenery the most beautiful and at a season when the foliage was most rich and varied the time flew away delightfully and when we came back into the world again it seemed as if i had waked from a dream that never was to return <\s>
<s> we travelled in an open carriage with one horse driven by dora and while we were in the highlands i walked most of the way by the side of the carriage which left us leisure to observe the beautiful appearances <\s>
<s> the rainbows and coloured mists floating about the hills were more like enchantment than anything i ever saw even among the alps <\s>
