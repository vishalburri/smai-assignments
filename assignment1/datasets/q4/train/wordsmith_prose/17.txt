<s> or is it likely if the native french manufacturers and traders were capable of rivalling us in point of skill that any frenchman would venture upon that ostentatious display of wealth which a large cotton mill for instance requires when he knows that by so doing he would only draw upon himself a glance of the greedy eye of government soon to be followed by a squeeze from its rapacious hand <\s>
<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>

<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>

<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>

<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>

<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>
<s> the smaller states must disappear and merge in the large nations and wide spread languages <\s>
<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>
<s> the reception which the senate gave to terentius varro after the battle of cannae is the sublimest event in human history <\s>
<s> what a contrast to the wretched conduct of the austrian government after the battle at wagram <\s>
<s> england requires as you have shown so eloquently and ably a new system of martial policy but england as well as the rest of europe requires what is more difficult to give it a new course of education a higher tone of moral feeling more of the grandeur of the imaginative faculties and less of the petty processes of the unfeeling and purblind understanding that would manage the concerns of nations in the same calculating spirit with which it would set about building a house <\s>
<s> now a state ought to be governed at least in these times the labours of the statesman ought to advance upon calculations and from impulses similar to those which give motion to the hand of a great artist when he is preparing a picture or of a mighty poet when he is determining the proportions and march of a poem much is to be done by rule the great outline is previously to be conceived in distinctness but the consummation of the work must be trusted to resources that are not tangible though known to exist <\s>
<s> much as i admire the political sagacity displayed in your work i respect you still more for the lofty spirit that supports it for the animation and courage with which it is replete for the contempt in a just cause of death and danger by which it is ennobled for its heroic confidence in the valour of your countrymen and the absolute determination which it everywhere expresses to maintain in all points the honour of the soldier's profession and that of the noble nation of which you are a member of the land in which you were born <\s>

<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>
<s> the smaller states must disappear and merge in the large nations and wide spread languages <\s>
<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>
<s> the reception which the senate gave to terentius varro after the battle of cannae is the sublimest event in human history <\s>
<s> what a contrast to the wretched conduct of the austrian government after the battle at wagram <\s>
<s> england requires as you have shown so eloquently and ably a new system of martial policy but england as well as the rest of europe requires what is more difficult to give it a new course of education a higher tone of moral feeling more of the grandeur of the imaginative faculties and less of the petty processes of the unfeeling and purblind understanding that would manage the concerns of nations in the same calculating spirit with which it would set about building a house <\s>
<s> now a state ought to be governed at least in these times the labours of the statesman ought to advance upon calculations and from impulses similar to those which give motion to the hand of a great artist when he is preparing a picture or of a mighty poet when he is determining the proportions and march of a poem much is to be done by rule the great outline is previously to be conceived in distinctness but the consummation of the work must be trusted to resources that are not tangible though known to exist <\s>

<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>
<s> the reception which the senate gave to terentius varro after the battle of cannae is the sublimest event in human history <\s>

<s> now a state ought to be governed at least in these times the labours of the statesman ought to advance upon calculations and from impulses similar to those which give motion to the hand of a great artist when he is preparing a picture or of a mighty poet when he is determining the proportions and march of a poem much is to be done by rule the great outline is previously to be conceived in distinctness but the consummation of the work must be trusted to resources that are not tangible though known to exist <\s>

<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>

<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>

<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>
<s> the smaller states must disappear and merge in the large nations and wide spread languages <\s>
<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>
<s> the reception which the senate gave to terentius varro after the battle of cannae is the sublimest event in human history <\s>
<s> what a contrast to the wretched conduct of the austrian government after the battle at wagram <\s>
<s> england requires as you have shown so eloquently and ably a new system of martial policy but england as well as the rest of europe requires what is more difficult to give it a new course of education a higher tone of moral feeling more of the grandeur of the imaginative faculties and less of the petty processes of the unfeeling and purblind understanding that would manage the concerns of nations in the same calculating spirit with which it would set about building a house <\s>
<s> now a state ought to be governed at least in these times the labours of the statesman ought to advance upon calculations and from impulses similar to those which give motion to the hand of a great artist when he is preparing a picture or of a mighty poet when he is determining the proportions and march of a poem much is to be done by rule the great outline is previously to be conceived in distinctness but the consummation of the work must be trusted to resources that are not tangible though known to exist <\s>

<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>

<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>

<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>

<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>

<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>

<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>

<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>

<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>

<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>

<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>

<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>

<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>

<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>

<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>

<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>

<s> we have the point to stand upon which archimedes wished for and we may move the continent if we persevere <\s>

<s> whatever money we advance for portugal and spain we can direct the management of it an inestimable advantage which with relation to prussia russia or austria we never possessed <\s>
<s> besides how could we govern the purposes of those states when that inherent imbecility and cowardice leave them no purpose or aim to which they can steadily adhere of themselves for six weeks together <\s>
<s> or is it likely if the native french manufacturers and traders were capable of rivalling us in point of skill that any frenchman would venture upon that ostentatious display of wealth which a large cotton mill for instance requires when he knows that by so doing he would only draw upon himself a glance of the greedy eye of government soon to be followed by a squeeze from its rapacious hand <\s>
<s> but i have dwelt too long upon this <\s>
<s> the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve <\s>
<s> our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground <\s>
<s> for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet <\s>
<s> in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them <\s>
<s> the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced <\s>
<s> why then am i for war with france <\s>
<s> because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day <\s>
<s> and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend <\s>
<s> too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work <\s>
<s> i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen <\s>
<s> but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay <\s>
<s> let me then come at once to a fundamental principle <\s>
<s> you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish <\s>
<s> in this i agree with you <\s>
<s> yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c <\s>
<s> now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germany yet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires <\s>
<s> all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent <\s>
<s> therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it <\s>
<s> if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves <\s>
<s> holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do <\s>
<s> as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend <\s>
<s> something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental <\s>
<s> adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights <\s>
<s> if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world <\s>
<s> we conquer italy that is we raise the british standard in italy and by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves <\s>
<s> this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book <\s>
<s> undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword <\s>
<s> but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession <\s>
<s> if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquired not otherwise <\s>
<s> if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so <\s>
<s> the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself <\s>
<s> your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition <\s>
<s> and how did they enter upon their career <\s>
<s> by an act of atrocious injustice <\s>
<s> you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was <\s>
<s> the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere <\s>
<s> their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power <\s>
<s> no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other <\s>
<s> the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles <\s>
<s> therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake <\s>
<s> accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain <\s>
<s> i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our sway in other words more at our mercy <\s>
<s> now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects <\s>
<s> could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately <\s>
<s> i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end <\s>
<s> woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible <\s>
<s> i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land <\s>
<s> scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with <\s>
<s> if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within <\s>
<s> universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured <\s>
<s> if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow <\s>
<s> indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness <\s>
<s> but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances <\s>
<s> my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arm's length <\s>
<s> do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent <\s>
<s> no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing <\s>
<s> france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another <\s>
<s> thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both <\s>
<s> their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth <\s>
<s> the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles <\s>
<s> the smaller states must disappear and merge in the large nations and wide spread languages <\s>
<s> the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue <\s>
<s> yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate <\s>
<s> military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues <\s>
<s> if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty ;[ 22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth <\s>
<s> the reception which the senate gave to terentius varro after the battle of cannae is the sublimest event in human history <\s>
<s> what a contrast to the wretched conduct of the austrian government after the battle at wagram <\s>
<s> england requires as you have shown so eloquently and ably a new system of martial policy but england as well as the rest of europe requires what is more difficult to give it a new course of education a higher tone of moral feeling more of the grandeur of the imaginative faculties and less of the petty processes of the unfeeling and purblind understanding that would manage the concerns of nations in the same calculating spirit with which it would set about building a house <\s>
