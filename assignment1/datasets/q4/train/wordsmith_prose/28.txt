<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>
<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>
<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>
<s> this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded <\s>
<s> passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition it will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the reader's mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss <\s>
<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>
<s> the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other <\s>
<s> the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest <\s>
<s> a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamented but the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires <\s>
<s> what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes <\s>
<s> the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen no nor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more <\s>
<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>
<s> this may easily be brought to the test <\s>
<s> let one whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man hear the tidings of his death and what a change is wrought in a moment <\s>
<s> enmity melts away and as it disappears unsightliness disproportion and deformity vanish and through the influence of commiseration a harmony of love and beauty succeeds <\s>
<s> bring such a man to the tomb stone on which shall be inscribed an epitaph on his adversary composed in the spirit which we have recommended <\s>

<s> it needs scarcely be said that an epitaph presupposes a monument upon which it is to be engraven <\s>
<s> almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred <\s>
<s> among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them <\s>
<s> this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory <\s>
<s> never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos <\s>
<s> i'm careless of a grave nature her dead will save <\s>
<s> as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled <\s>
<s> i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one <\s>
<s> the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of fore feeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres <\s>
<s> and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it <\s>
<s> the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot pre conceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him <\s>
<s> add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire <\s>
<s> doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction yet not i think as a direct result but only to be come at through an intermediate thought viz <\s>
<s> that of an intimation or assurance within us that some part of our nature is imperishable <\s>
<s> at least the precedence in order of birth of one feeling to the other is unquestionable <\s>
<s> if we look back upon the days of childhood we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when with respect to our own individual being the mind was without this assurance whereas the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death or even in absence is as we shall discover a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed and the reason has connected itself with a wide range of objects <\s>
<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>
<s> has such an unfolder of the mysteries of nature though he may have forgotten his former self ever noticed the early obstinate and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children upon the subject of origination <\s>
<s> this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither <\s>
<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>
<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>

<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>
<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>
<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>
<s> this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded <\s>
<s> passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition it will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the reader's mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss <\s>
<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>
<s> the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other <\s>
<s> the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest <\s>
<s> a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamented but the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires <\s>
<s> what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes <\s>
<s> the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen no nor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more <\s>
<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>
<s> this may easily be brought to the test <\s>
<s> let one whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man hear the tidings of his death and what a change is wrought in a moment <\s>
<s> enmity melts away and as it disappears unsightliness disproportion and deformity vanish and through the influence of commiseration a harmony of love and beauty succeeds <\s>
<s> bring such a man to the tomb stone on which shall be inscribed an epitaph on his adversary composed in the spirit which we have recommended <\s>

<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>

<s> this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither <\s>
<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>
<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>

<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>

<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>

<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>

<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>

<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>
<s> this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded <\s>
<s> passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition it will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the reader's mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss <\s>
<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>
<s> the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other <\s>
<s> the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest <\s>
<s> a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamented but the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires <\s>
<s> what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes <\s>
<s> the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen no nor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more <\s>
<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>
<s> this may easily be brought to the test <\s>
<s> let one whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man hear the tidings of his death and what a change is wrought in a moment <\s>

<s> almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred <\s>
<s> among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them <\s>
<s> this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory <\s>
<s> never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos <\s>
<s> i'm careless of a grave nature her dead will save <\s>
<s> as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled <\s>
<s> i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one <\s>
<s> the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of fore feeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres <\s>
<s> and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it <\s>
<s> the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot pre conceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him <\s>
<s> add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire <\s>
<s> doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction yet not i think as a direct result but only to be come at through an intermediate thought viz <\s>
<s> that of an intimation or assurance within us that some part of our nature is imperishable <\s>
<s> at least the precedence in order of birth of one feeling to the other is unquestionable <\s>
<s> if we look back upon the days of childhood we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when with respect to our own individual being the mind was without this assurance whereas the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death or even in absence is as we shall discover a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed and the reason has connected itself with a wide range of objects <\s>
<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>

<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>

<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>
<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>

<s> it needs scarcely be said that an epitaph presupposes a monument upon which it is to be engraven <\s>
<s> almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred <\s>
<s> among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them <\s>
<s> this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory <\s>
<s> never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos <\s>
<s> i'm careless of a grave nature her dead will save <\s>
<s> as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled <\s>
<s> i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one <\s>
<s> the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of fore feeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres <\s>
<s> and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it <\s>
<s> the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot pre conceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him <\s>
<s> add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire <\s>
<s> doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction yet not i think as a direct result but only to be come at through an intermediate thought viz <\s>
<s> that of an intimation or assurance within us that some part of our nature is imperishable <\s>
<s> at least the precedence in order of birth of one feeling to the other is unquestionable <\s>
<s> if we look back upon the days of childhood we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when with respect to our own individual being the mind was without this assurance whereas the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death or even in absence is as we shall discover a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed and the reason has connected itself with a wide range of objects <\s>
<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>
<s> has such an unfolder of the mysteries of nature though he may have forgotten his former self ever noticed the early obstinate and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children upon the subject of origination <\s>
<s> this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither <\s>
<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>

<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>
<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>
<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>
<s> this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded <\s>
<s> passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition it will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the reader's mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss <\s>
<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>
<s> the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other <\s>
<s> the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest <\s>
<s> a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamented but the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires <\s>
<s> what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes <\s>
<s> the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen no nor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more <\s>
<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>

<s> it needs scarcely be said that an epitaph presupposes a monument upon which it is to be engraven <\s>
<s> almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred <\s>
<s> among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them <\s>
<s> this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory <\s>
<s> never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos <\s>
<s> i'm careless of a grave nature her dead will save <\s>
<s> as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled <\s>
<s> i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one <\s>
<s> the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of fore feeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres <\s>
<s> and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it <\s>
<s> the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot pre conceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him <\s>
<s> add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire <\s>
<s> doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction yet not i think as a direct result but only to be come at through an intermediate thought viz <\s>
<s> that of an intimation or assurance within us that some part of our nature is imperishable <\s>
<s> at least the precedence in order of birth of one feeling to the other is unquestionable <\s>
<s> if we look back upon the days of childhood we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when with respect to our own individual being the mind was without this assurance whereas the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death or even in absence is as we shall discover a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed and the reason has connected itself with a wide range of objects <\s>
<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>
<s> has such an unfolder of the mysteries of nature though he may have forgotten his former self ever noticed the early obstinate and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children upon the subject of origination <\s>
<s> this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither <\s>
<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>
<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>

<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>
<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>
<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>
<s> this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded <\s>
<s> passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition it will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the reader's mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss <\s>
<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>
<s> the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other <\s>
<s> the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest <\s>
<s> a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamented but the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires <\s>
<s> what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes <\s>
<s> the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen no nor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more <\s>
<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>
<s> this may easily be brought to the test <\s>
<s> let one whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man hear the tidings of his death and what a change is wrought in a moment <\s>
<s> enmity melts away and as it disappears unsightliness disproportion and deformity vanish and through the influence of commiseration a harmony of love and beauty succeeds <\s>
<s> bring such a man to the tomb stone on which shall be inscribed an epitaph on his adversary composed in the spirit which we have recommended <\s>

<s> it needs scarcely be said that an epitaph presupposes a monument upon which it is to be engraven <\s>
<s> almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred <\s>
<s> among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them <\s>
<s> this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory <\s>
<s> never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos <\s>
<s> i'm careless of a grave nature her dead will save <\s>
<s> as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled <\s>
<s> i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one <\s>
<s> the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of fore feeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres <\s>
<s> and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it <\s>
<s> the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot pre conceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him <\s>
<s> add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire <\s>
<s> doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction yet not i think as a direct result but only to be come at through an intermediate thought viz <\s>
<s> that of an intimation or assurance within us that some part of our nature is imperishable <\s>
<s> at least the precedence in order of birth of one feeling to the other is unquestionable <\s>
<s> if we look back upon the days of childhood we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when with respect to our own individual being the mind was without this assurance whereas the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death or even in absence is as we shall discover a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed and the reason has connected itself with a wide range of objects <\s>
<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>
<s> has such an unfolder of the mysteries of nature though he may have forgotten his former self ever noticed the early obstinate and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children upon the subject of origination <\s>
<s> this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither <\s>
<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>
<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>

<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>

<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>
<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>
<s> this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded <\s>
<s> passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition it will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the reader's mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss <\s>
<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>
<s> the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other <\s>
<s> the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest <\s>
<s> a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamented but the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires <\s>
<s> what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes <\s>
<s> the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen no nor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more <\s>
<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>
<s> this may easily be brought to the test <\s>
<s> let one whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man hear the tidings of his death and what a change is wrought in a moment <\s>
<s> enmity melts away and as it disappears unsightliness disproportion and deformity vanish and through the influence of commiseration a harmony of love and beauty succeeds <\s>

<s> almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred <\s>
<s> among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them <\s>
<s> this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory <\s>
<s> never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos <\s>
<s> i'm careless of a grave nature her dead will save <\s>
<s> as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled <\s>
<s> i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one <\s>
<s> the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of fore feeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres <\s>
<s> and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it <\s>
<s> the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot pre conceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him <\s>
<s> add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire <\s>

<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>
<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>

<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>

<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>

<s> almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred <\s>
<s> among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them <\s>
<s> this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory <\s>
<s> never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos <\s>
<s> i'm careless of a grave nature her dead will save <\s>
<s> as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled <\s>
<s> i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one <\s>
<s> the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of fore feeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres <\s>
<s> and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it <\s>
<s> the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot pre conceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him <\s>
<s> add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire <\s>
<s> doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction yet not i think as a direct result but only to be come at through an intermediate thought viz <\s>
<s> that of an intimation or assurance within us that some part of our nature is imperishable <\s>
<s> at least the precedence in order of birth of one feeling to the other is unquestionable <\s>
<s> if we look back upon the days of childhood we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when with respect to our own individual being the mind was without this assurance whereas the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death or even in absence is as we shall discover a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed and the reason has connected itself with a wide range of objects <\s>
<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>
<s> has such an unfolder of the mysteries of nature though he may have forgotten his former self ever noticed the early obstinate and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children upon the subject of origination <\s>
<s> this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither <\s>
<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>

<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>
<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>
<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>

<s> it needs scarcely be said that an epitaph presupposes a monument upon which it is to be engraven <\s>
<s> almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred <\s>
<s> among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them <\s>
<s> this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory <\s>
<s> never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos <\s>
<s> i'm careless of a grave nature her dead will save <\s>
<s> as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled <\s>
<s> i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one <\s>
<s> the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of fore feeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres <\s>
<s> and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it <\s>
<s> the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot pre conceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him <\s>
<s> add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire <\s>
<s> doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction yet not i think as a direct result but only to be come at through an intermediate thought viz <\s>
<s> that of an intimation or assurance within us that some part of our nature is imperishable <\s>
<s> at least the precedence in order of birth of one feeling to the other is unquestionable <\s>
<s> if we look back upon the days of childhood we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when with respect to our own individual being the mind was without this assurance whereas the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death or even in absence is as we shall discover a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed and the reason has connected itself with a wide range of objects <\s>
<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>
<s> has such an unfolder of the mysteries of nature though he may have forgotten his former self ever noticed the early obstinate and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children upon the subject of origination <\s>
<s> this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither <\s>
<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>
<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>

<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>
<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>
<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>
<s> this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded <\s>
<s> passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition it will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the reader's mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss <\s>
<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>
<s> the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other <\s>
<s> the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest <\s>
<s> a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamented but the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires <\s>
<s> what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes <\s>
<s> the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen no nor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more <\s>
<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>
<s> this may easily be brought to the test <\s>
<s> let one whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man hear the tidings of his death and what a change is wrought in a moment <\s>
<s> enmity melts away and as it disappears unsightliness disproportion and deformity vanish and through the influence of commiseration a harmony of love and beauty succeeds <\s>
<s> bring such a man to the tomb stone on which shall be inscribed an epitaph on his adversary composed in the spirit which we have recommended <\s>

<s> it needs scarcely be said that an epitaph presupposes a monument upon which it is to be engraven <\s>
<s> almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred <\s>
<s> among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them <\s>
<s> this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory <\s>
<s> never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos <\s>
<s> i'm careless of a grave nature her dead will save <\s>
<s> as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled <\s>
<s> i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one <\s>
<s> the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of fore feeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres <\s>
<s> and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it <\s>
<s> the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot pre conceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him <\s>
<s> add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire <\s>
<s> doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction yet not i think as a direct result but only to be come at through an intermediate thought viz <\s>
<s> that of an intimation or assurance within us that some part of our nature is imperishable <\s>
<s> at least the precedence in order of birth of one feeling to the other is unquestionable <\s>
<s> if we look back upon the days of childhood we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when with respect to our own individual being the mind was without this assurance whereas the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death or even in absence is as we shall discover a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed and the reason has connected itself with a wide range of objects <\s>
<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>
<s> has such an unfolder of the mysteries of nature though he may have forgotten his former self ever noticed the early obstinate and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children upon the subject of origination <\s>
<s> this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither <\s>
<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>
<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>

<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>
<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>
<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>
<s> this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded <\s>
<s> passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition it will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the reader's mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss <\s>
<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>
<s> the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other <\s>
<s> the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest <\s>
<s> a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamented but the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires <\s>
<s> what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes <\s>
<s> the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen no nor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more <\s>
<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>
<s> this may easily be brought to the test <\s>
<s> let one whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man hear the tidings of his death and what a change is wrought in a moment <\s>
<s> enmity melts away and as it disappears unsightliness disproportion and deformity vanish and through the influence of commiseration a harmony of love and beauty succeeds <\s>
<s> bring such a man to the tomb stone on which shall be inscribed an epitaph on his adversary composed in the spirit which we have recommended <\s>

<s> forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him <\s>

<s> this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither <\s>
<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>
<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>

<s> origin and tendency are notions inseparably co relative <\s>
<s> never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what never wearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress <\s>
<s> what receptacle can contain the mighty influx <\s>
<s> and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in nature these might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably a receptacle without bounds or dimensions nothing less than infinity <\s>
<s> we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a co existent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out <\s>
<s> this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us <\s>
<s> i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy <\s>
<s> were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow if then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world <\s>
<s> simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the sea side he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act <\s>
<s> another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird <\s>
<s> but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tender hearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty <\s>
<s> and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves <\s>
<s> we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul <\s>
<s> each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrast it is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other <\s>
<s> as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birth place in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory things of sorrow and of tears <\s>
<s> on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand <\s>
<s> accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship <\s>
<s> in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the way sides <\s>
<s> i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice <\s>
<s> we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature from the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by <\s>
<s> many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller <\s>
<s> so often found upon the monuments <\s>
<s> and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer of misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him of beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountain top of admonitions and heart stirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain <\s>
<s> these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unison we in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them <\s>
<s> even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind <\s>
<s> to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless church yard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed <\s>
<s> thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day <\s>
<s> the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burial ground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country then in some rural calm sequestered spot where healing nature her benignant look ne'er changes save at that lorn season when with tresses drooping o'er her sable stole she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man her noblest work so israel's virgins erst with annual moan upon the mountains wept their fairest gone there in that rural scene so placid so congenial to the wish the christian feels of peaceful rest within the silent grave i would have stayed wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven lay on the humbler graves around what time the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds pensive as though like me in lonely muse twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath <\s>
<s> there while with him the holy man of uz o'er human destiny i sympathised counting the long long periods prophecy decrees to roll ere the great day arrives of resurrection oft the blue eyed spring had met me with her blossoms as the dove of old returned with olive leaf to cheer the patriarch mourning o'er a world destroyed and i would bless her visit for to me tis sweet to trace the consonance that links as one the works of nature and the word of god john edwards <\s>
<s> a village church yard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself <\s>
<s> the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbath day in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying <\s>
<s> hence a parish church in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both <\s>
<s> as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worth upon personal or social sorrow and admiration upon religion individual and social upon time and upon eternity <\s>
<s> accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit <\s>
<s> but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary <\s>
<s> it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude <\s>
<s> a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory <\s>
<s> this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand church yards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them <\s>
<s> this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr <\s>
<s> johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all <\s>
<s> such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject <\s>
<s> the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it <\s>
<s> the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time <\s>
<s> we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted <\s>
<s> the affections are their own justification <\s>
<s> the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded <\s>
<s> we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the all uniting and equalising receptacle of the dead <\s>
<s> the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of death the source from which an epitaph proceeds of death and of life <\s>
<s> to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence <\s>
<s> this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded <\s>
<s> passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition it will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the reader's mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss <\s>
<s> the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions images circumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy <\s>
<s> the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other <\s>
<s> the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest <\s>
<s> a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamented but the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires <\s>
<s> what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes <\s>
<s> the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen no nor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more <\s>
<s> shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered it is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by love the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living <\s>
<s> this may easily be brought to the test <\s>
<s> let one whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man hear the tidings of his death and what a change is wrought in a moment <\s>
<s> enmity melts away and as it disappears unsightliness disproportion and deformity vanish and through the influence of commiseration a harmony of love and beauty succeeds <\s>
<s> bring such a man to the tomb stone on which shall be inscribed an epitaph on his adversary composed in the spirit which we have recommended <\s>
<s> would he turn from it as from an idle tale <\s>
