<s> the prayers of survivors during passionate grief for the recent loss of relatives and friends as the object of those prayers could no longer be the suffering body of the dying would naturally be ejaculated for the souls of the departed the barriers between the two worlds dissolving before the power of love and faith <\s>
<s> the ministers of religion from their habitual attendance upon sick beds would be daily witnesses of these benign results and hence would be strongly tempted to aim at giving to them permanence by embodying them in rites and ceremonies recurring at stated periods <\s>
<s> all this as it was in course of nature so was it blameless and even praiseworthy since some of its effects in that rude state of society could not but be salutary <\s>
<s> no reflecting person however can view without sorrow the abuses which rose out of thus formalising sublime instincts and disinterested movements of passion and perverting them into means of gratifying the ambition and rapacity of the priesthood <\s>
<s> but while we deplore and are indignant at these abuses it would be a great mistake if we imputed the origin of the offices to prospective selfishness on the part of the monks and clergy they were at first sincere in their sympathy and in their degree dupes rather of their own creed than artful and designing men <\s>

<s> in the frith of clyde ailsa crag during an eclipse of the sun july 17 1833 <\s>
<s> xxiii the morning of the eclipse was exquisitely beautiful while we passed the crag as described in the sonnet <\s>
<s> on the deck of the steamboat were several persons of the poor and labouring class and i could not but be struck with their cheerful talk with each other while not one of them seemed to notice the magnificent objects with which we were surrounded and even the phenomenon of the eclipse attracted but little of their attention <\s>
<s> was it right not to regret this <\s>
<s> they appeared to me however so much alive in their own minds to their own concerns that i could not but look upon it as a misfortune that they had little perception for such pleasures as cannot be cultivated without ease and leisure <\s>
<s> yet if one surveys life in all its duties and relations such ease and leisure will not be found so enviable a privilege as it may at first appear <\s>
<s> natural philosophy painting and poetry and refined taste are no doubt great acquisitions to society but among those who dedicate themselves to such pursuits it is to be feared that few are as happy and as consistent in the management of their lives as the class of persons who at that time led me into this course of reflection <\s>
<s> i do not mean by this to be understood to derogate from intellectual pursuits for that would be monstrous <\s>

<s> it is remarkable that though burns lived some time here and during much the most productive period of his poetical life he nowhere adverts to the splendid prospects stretching towards the sea and bounded by the peaks of arran on one part which in clear weather he must have had daily before his eyes <\s>
<s> yet this is easily explained <\s>
<s> in one of his poetical effusions he speaks of describing fair nature's face as a privilege on which he sets a high value nevertheless natural appearances rarely take a lead in his poetry <\s>
<s> it is as a human being eminently sensitive and intelligent and not as a poet clad in his priestly robes and carrying the ensigns of sacerdotal office that he interests and affects us <\s>
<s> whether he speaks of rivers hills and woods it is not so much on account of the properties with which they are absolutely endowed as relatively to local patriotic remembrances and associations or as they are ministerial to personal feelings especially those of love whether happy or otherwise yet it is not always so <\s>
<s> soon after we had passed mosgiel farm we crossed the ayr murmuring and winding through a narrow woody hollow <\s>
