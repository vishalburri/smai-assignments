<s> j recollections of wordsworth <\s>
<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>
<s> their inquiries i fancied were about wordsworth perhaps as to the hour of service the next day sunday with the hope of seeing him there <\s>
<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>
<s> he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further <\s>
<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>
<s> no other american has he honoured in the same degree and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended <\s>
<s> the love which has so long animated you has been such that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source <\s>
<s> i have been led as i said at the beginning of my letter to make this record partly from your suggestion and partly from a remark of southey which i have lately seen to the effect that wordsworth was one of whom posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered <\s>
<s> you will not i trust deem the incidents i have set down trivial or consider any detail too minute the object of which was only to bring the living man before you <\s>
<s> now that he has gone for ever from our sight in this world i am led to look back to the interview with a deeper satisfaction and it may be that this full account of it will have value hereafter <\s>
<s> to you it was due that i should make the record by myself these remembrances will ever be cherished among my choicest possessions <\s>

<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>

<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>

<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>
<s> he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further <\s>
<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>
<s> no other american has he honoured in the same degree and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended <\s>
<s> the love which has so long animated you has been such that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source <\s>
<s> i have been led as i said at the beginning of my letter to make this record partly from your suggestion and partly from a remark of southey which i have lately seen to the effect that wordsworth was one of whom posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered <\s>

<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>

<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>

<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>

<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>

<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>

<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>

<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>

<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>

<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>
<s> their inquiries i fancied were about wordsworth perhaps as to the hour of service the next day sunday with the hope of seeing him there <\s>
<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>
<s> he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further <\s>
<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>

<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>

<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>

<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>

<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>

<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>

<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>

<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>

<s> j recollections of wordsworth <\s>
<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>

<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>
<s> their inquiries i fancied were about wordsworth perhaps as to the hour of service the next day sunday with the hope of seeing him there <\s>
<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>
<s> he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further <\s>
<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>

<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>

<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>

<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>

<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>

<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>

<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>

<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>
<s> no other american has he honoured in the same degree and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended <\s>
<s> the love which has so long animated you has been such that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source <\s>
<s> i have been led as i said at the beginning of my letter to make this record partly from your suggestion and partly from a remark of southey which i have lately seen to the effect that wordsworth was one of whom posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>

<s> j recollections of wordsworth <\s>
<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>
<s> their inquiries i fancied were about wordsworth perhaps as to the hour of service the next day sunday with the hope of seeing him there <\s>
<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>
<s> he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further <\s>
<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>
<s> no other american has he honoured in the same degree and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended <\s>
<s> the love which has so long animated you has been such that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source <\s>
<s> i have been led as i said at the beginning of my letter to make this record partly from your suggestion and partly from a remark of southey which i have lately seen to the effect that wordsworth was one of whom posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered <\s>
<s> you will not i trust deem the incidents i have set down trivial or consider any detail too minute the object of which was only to bring the living man before you <\s>
<s> now that he has gone for ever from our sight in this world i am led to look back to the interview with a deeper satisfaction and it may be that this full account of it will have value hereafter <\s>
<s> to you it was due that i should make the record by myself these remembrances will ever be cherished among my choicest possessions <\s>

<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>

<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>

<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>
<s> he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further <\s>
<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>
<s> no other american has he honoured in the same degree and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended <\s>
<s> the love which has so long animated you has been such that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source <\s>
<s> i have been led as i said at the beginning of my letter to make this record partly from your suggestion and partly from a remark of southey which i have lately seen to the effect that wordsworth was one of whom posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered <\s>

<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>

<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>

<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>

<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>

<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>

<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>

<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>

<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>

<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>
<s> their inquiries i fancied were about wordsworth perhaps as to the hour of service the next day sunday with the hope of seeing him there <\s>
<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>
<s> he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further <\s>
<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>

<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>

<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>

<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>

<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>

<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>

<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>

<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>

<s> j recollections of wordsworth <\s>
<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>

<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>
<s> their inquiries i fancied were about wordsworth perhaps as to the hour of service the next day sunday with the hope of seeing him there <\s>
<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>
<s> he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further <\s>
<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>

<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>

<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>

<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>

<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>

<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>

<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>

<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>
<s> no other american has he honoured in the same degree and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended <\s>
<s> the love which has so long animated you has been such that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source <\s>
<s> i have been led as i said at the beginning of my letter to make this record partly from your suggestion and partly from a remark of southey which i have lately seen to the effect that wordsworth was one of whom posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>

<s> j recollections of wordsworth <\s>
<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
<s> it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice <\s>
<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>
<s> and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return <\s>
<s> but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood <\s>
<s> he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside <\s>
<s> as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door <\s>
<s> their inquiries i fancied were about wordsworth perhaps as to the hour of service the next day sunday with the hope of seeing him there <\s>
<s> one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze <\s>
<s> i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration <\s>
<s> he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further <\s>
<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>
<s> no other american has he honoured in the same degree and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended <\s>
<s> the love which has so long animated you has been such that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source <\s>
<s> i have been led as i said at the beginning of my letter to make this record partly from your suggestion and partly from a remark of southey which i have lately seen to the effect that wordsworth was one of whom posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered <\s>
<s> you will not i trust deem the incidents i have set down trivial or consider any detail too minute the object of which was only to bring the living man before you <\s>
<s> now that he has gone for ever from our sight in this world i am led to look back to the interview with a deeper satisfaction and it may be that this full account of it will have value hereafter <\s>
<s> to you it was due that i should make the record by myself these remembrances will ever be cherished among my choicest possessions <\s>

<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>

<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>

<s> i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy services' one who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellow men <\s>

<s> giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted <\s>
<s> i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview <\s>
<s> my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview <\s>
<s> i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time <\s>
<s> no word of unkindness had fallen from him <\s>
<s> he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection <\s>
<s> a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him <\s>
<s> believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life <\s>
<s> to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied <\s>
<s> you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence <\s>
<s> no other american has he honoured in the same degree and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended <\s>
<s> the love which has so long animated you has been such that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source <\s>
<s> i have been led as i said at the beginning of my letter to make this record partly from your suggestion and partly from a remark of southey which i have lately seen to the effect that wordsworth was one of whom posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered <\s>

<s> j recollections of wordsworth <\s>
<s> by aubrey de vere esq <\s>
<s> sent to the present editor and now first published part i <\s>
<s> it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth <\s>
<s> during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof <\s>
<s> the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him <\s>
<s> in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyre it was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this <\s>
<s> in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deep hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age <\s>
<s> there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality <\s>
<s> they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree <\s>
<s> all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important <\s>
<s> the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworth's poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse <\s>
<s> in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit <\s>
<s> an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered <\s>
<s> he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of england's modern poets one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect <\s>
<s> he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and note book and jotted down whatever struck him most a river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries <\s>
<s> he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description <\s>
<s> after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms <\s>
<s> he should have left his pencil and note book at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy <\s>
<s> then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene <\s>
<s> he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated <\s>
<s> that which remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic <\s>
<s> in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental <\s>
<s> a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them <\s>
<s> on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow <\s>
<s> he makes me write the swans on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake float double swans and shadow but i wrote the swan on still st <\s>
<s> never could i have written swans in the plural <\s>
<s> the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water <\s>
<s> it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow <\s>
<s> had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them <\s>
<s> he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern her which he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment <\s>
<s> he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachings except here he interrupted himself one person <\s>
<s> there was a young clergyman called frederick faber 269 who resided at ambleside <\s>
<s> he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected <\s>
<s> 269 afterwards father faber of the oratory <\s>
<s> his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions <\s>
<s> truth he used to say that is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the whole this he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry <\s>
<s> he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments <\s>
<s> it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets <\s>
<s> it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama <\s>
<s> it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human <\s>
<s> his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood <\s>
<s> his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency <\s>
<s> nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect <\s>
<s> he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness <\s>
<s> for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances <\s>
<s> if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest <\s>
<s> wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest <\s>
<s> dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to out soar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt <\s>
<s> i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets <\s>
<s> all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels <\s>
<s> first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those first class poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature <\s>
<s> those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations <\s>
<s> this was not the fact <\s>
<s> there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived <\s>
<s> it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being <\s>
<s> the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yew trees of borrowdale <\s>
<s> but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent <\s>
<s> when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual <\s>
<s> he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry 270 270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before <\s>
<s> the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness <\s>
<s> yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger <\s>
<s> he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already to day as if to account for his being then unprovided <\s>
<s> wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir <\s>
<s> by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain <\s>
<s> imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses a self dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed <\s>
<s> your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope <\s>
<s> i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness <\s>
<s> he made but little comment on your notice of him <\s>
<s> occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact that's quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add that's from my writings <\s>
<s> these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed <\s>
