<s> i do not speak with accuracy nor on such a subject is accuracy requisite but i am not far wide of truth in saying that a fifth part of the million is more than sufficient to defray the expenses of the royal household <\s>

<s> but some one may think and indeed it has been studiously inculcated into the minds of the multitude that a monarchy even a limited one is a far more expensive mode of civil government than a republic that a civil list of a million a year is an enormous sum which might be saved to the nation <\s>

<s> a great portion of this million is expended in paying the salaries of the judges the interpreters of our law the guardians of our lives and properties another portion is expended in maintaining ambassadors at different courts to protect the general concerns of the nation from foreign aggression another portion is expended in pensions and donations to men of letters and ingenuity to men who have by naval military or civil services just claims to the attention of their country to persons of respectable families and connections who have been humbled and broken down by misfortunes <\s>
<s> i do not speak with accuracy nor on such a subject is accuracy requisite but i am not far wide of truth in saying that a fifth part of the million is more than sufficient to defray the expenses of the royal household <\s>

<s> and are there any men in this kingdom except such as find their account in public confusion who would hazard the introduction of such scenes of rapine barbarity and bloodshed as have disgraced france and outraged humanity for the sake of obtaining what liberty and equality <\s>

<s> the greatest freedom that can be enjoyed by man in a state of civil society the greatest security that can be given him with respect to the protection of his character property personal liberty limb and life is afforded to every individual by our present constitution <\s>
<s> the equality of men in a state of nature does not consist in an equality of bodily strength or intellectual ability but in their being equally free from the dominion of each other <\s>
<s> the equality of men in a state of civil society does not consist in an equality of wisdom honesty ingenuity industry nor in an equality of property resulting from a due exertion of these talents but in being equally subject to equally protected by the same laws <\s>
<s> and who knows not that every individual in this great nation is in this respect equal to every other <\s>
<s> there is not one law for the nobles another for the commons of the land one for the clergy another for the laity one for the rich another for the poor <\s>
<s> the nobility it is true have some privileges annexed to their birth the judges and other magistrates have some annexed to their office and professional men have some annexed to their professions but these privileges are neither injurious to the liberty or property of other men <\s>
<s> and you might as reasonably contend that the bramble ought to be equal to the oak the lamb to the lion as that no distinctions should take place between the members of the same society <\s>
<s> the burdens of the state are distributed through the whole community with as much impartiality as the complex nature of taxation will admit every man sustains a part in proportion to his strength no order is exempted from the payment of taxes <\s>

<s> i thought that the state ought not in justice to have seized any part of the property of the church till it had reverted as it were to the community by the death of its immediate possessors <\s>
<s> i thought that the king was not only treated with unmerited indignity but that too little authority was left him to enable him as the chief executive magistrate to be useful to the state <\s>

<s> as to other evils which took place on the occasion i considered them certainly as evils of importance but at the same time as evils inseparable from a state of civil commotion and which i conceived would be more than compensated by the establishment of a limited monarchy <\s>
<s> the french have abandoned the constitution they had at first established and have changed it for another <\s>

<s> with regard to france i have no hesitation in declaring that the object which the french seemed to have in view at the commencement of their revolution had my hearty approbation <\s>

<s> it is one thing to approve of an end another to approve of the means by which an end is accomplished <\s>
<s> i did not approve of the means by which the first revolution was effected in france <\s>
<s> i thought that it would have been a wiser measure to have abridged the oppressive privileges and to have lessened the enormous number of the nobility than to have abolished the order <\s>
<s> i thought that the state ought not in justice to have seized any part of the property of the church till it had reverted as it were to the community by the death of its immediate possessors <\s>
<s> i thought that the king was not only treated with unmerited indignity but that too little authority was left him to enable him as the chief executive magistrate to be useful to the state <\s>
<s> these were some of my reasons for not approving the means by which the first revolution in france was brought about <\s>
<s> as to other evils which took place on the occasion i considered them certainly as evils of importance but at the same time as evils inseparable from a state of civil commotion and which i conceived would be more than compensated by the establishment of a limited monarchy <\s>
<s> the french have abandoned the constitution they had at first established and have changed it for another <\s>

<s> i do not speak with accuracy nor on such a subject is accuracy requisite but i am not far wide of truth in saying that a fifth part of the million is more than sufficient to defray the expenses of the royal household <\s>

<s> the liberty of the press is a main support of the liberty of the nation it is a blessing which it is our duty to transmit to posterity but a bad use is sometimes made of it and its use is never more pernicious than when it is employed to infuse into the minds of the lowest orders of the community disparaging ideas concerning the constitution of their country <\s>
<s> no danger need be apprehended from a candid examination of our own constitution or from a display of the advantages of any other it will bear to be contrasted with the best but all men are not qualified to make the comparison and there are so many men in every community who wish to have no government at all that an appeal to them on such a point ought never to be made <\s>

<s> the greatest freedom that can be enjoyed by man in a state of civil society the greatest security that can be given him with respect to the protection of his character property personal liberty limb and life is afforded to every individual by our present constitution <\s>
<s> the equality of men in a state of nature does not consist in an equality of bodily strength or intellectual ability but in their being equally free from the dominion of each other <\s>
<s> the equality of men in a state of civil society does not consist in an equality of wisdom honesty ingenuity industry nor in an equality of property resulting from a due exertion of these talents but in being equally subject to equally protected by the same laws <\s>

<s> other nations may deluge their land with blood in struggling for liberty and equality but let it never be forgotten by ourselves and let us impress the observation upon the hearts of our children that we are in possession of both of as much of both as can be consistent with the end for which civil society was introduced amongst mankind <\s>

<s> but some one may think and indeed it has been studiously inculcated into the minds of the multitude that a monarchy even a limited one is a far more expensive mode of civil government than a republic that a civil list of a million a year is an enormous sum which might be saved to the nation <\s>

<s> i am not nor have ever been the patron of corruption <\s>

<s> a great portion of this million is expended in paying the salaries of the judges the interpreters of our law the guardians of our lives and properties another portion is expended in maintaining ambassadors at different courts to protect the general concerns of the nation from foreign aggression another portion is expended in pensions and donations to men of letters and ingenuity to men who have by naval military or civil services just claims to the attention of their country to persons of respectable families and connections who have been humbled and broken down by misfortunes <\s>
<s> i do not speak with accuracy nor on such a subject is accuracy requisite but i am not far wide of truth in saying that a fifth part of the million is more than sufficient to defray the expenses of the royal household <\s>

<s> i thought that the state ought not in justice to have seized any part of the property of the church till it had reverted as it were to the community by the death of its immediate possessors <\s>
<s> i thought that the king was not only treated with unmerited indignity but that too little authority was left him to enable him as the chief executive magistrate to be useful to the state <\s>

<s> as to other evils which took place on the occasion i considered them certainly as evils of importance but at the same time as evils inseparable from a state of civil commotion and which i conceived would be more than compensated by the establishment of a limited monarchy <\s>
<s> the french have abandoned the constitution they had at first established and have changed it for another <\s>

<s> with respect to the means by which this new republic has been erected in france they have been sanguinary savage more than brutal <\s>
<s> they not merely fill the heart of every individual with commiseration for the unfortunate sufferers but they exhibit to the eye of contemplation an humiliating picture of human nature when its passions are not regulated by religion or controlled by law <\s>
<s> i fly with terror and abhorrence even from the altar of liberty when i see it stained with the blood of the aged of the innocent of the defenceless sex of the ministers of religion and of the faithful adherents of a fallen monarch <\s>

<s> surely it would have been no diminution of the sternness of new republican virtue no disgrace to the magnanimity of a great nation if it had pardoned the perfidy which its own oppression had occasioned if it had remitted the punishment of the perjury of the king to the tribunal of him by whom kings reign and princes decree justice <\s>
<s> and are there any men in this kingdom except such as find their account in public confusion who would hazard the introduction of such scenes of rapine barbarity and bloodshed as have disgraced france and outraged humanity for the sake of obtaining what liberty and equality <\s>

<s> strike speedily we beseech thee with deep contrition and sincere remorse the obdurate hearts of the relentless perpetrators and projectors of these horrid deeds lest they should suddenly sink into eternal and extreme perdition loaded with an unutterable weight of unrepented and except through the blood of him whose religion they reject inexpiable sin <\s>
<s> the monarch you will tell me was guilty of perfidy and perjury <\s>

<s> i suspect that the meaning of these terms is not clearly and generally understood it may be of use to explain them <\s>

<s> as to other evils which took place on the occasion i considered them certainly as evils of importance but at the same time as evils inseparable from a state of civil commotion and which i conceived would be more than compensated by the establishment of a limited monarchy <\s>

<s> but some one may think and indeed it has been studiously inculcated into the minds of the multitude that a monarchy even a limited one is a far more expensive mode of civil government than a republic that a civil list of a million a year is an enormous sum which might be saved to the nation <\s>

<s> i am not nor have ever been the patron of corruption <\s>

<s> a great portion of this million is expended in paying the salaries of the judges the interpreters of our law the guardians of our lives and properties another portion is expended in maintaining ambassadors at different courts to protect the general concerns of the nation from foreign aggression another portion is expended in pensions and donations to men of letters and ingenuity to men who have by naval military or civil services just claims to the attention of their country to persons of respectable families and connections who have been humbled and broken down by misfortunes <\s>
<s> i do not speak with accuracy nor on such a subject is accuracy requisite but i am not far wide of truth in saying that a fifth part of the million is more than sufficient to defray the expenses of the royal household <\s>
<s> what a mighty matter is it to complain of that each individual contributes less than sixpence a year towards the support of the monarchy <\s>
<s> that the constitution of this country is so perfect as neither to require or admit of any improvement is a proposition to which i never did or ever can assent but i think it far too excellent to be amended by peasants and mechanics <\s>
<s> i do not mean to speak of peasants and mechanics with any degree of disrespect i am not so ignorant of the importance either of the natural or social chain by which all the individuals of the human race are connected together as to think disrespectfully of any link of it <\s>
<s> peasants and mechanics are as useful to the state as any other order of men but their utility consists in their discharging well the duties of their respective stations it ceases when they affect to become legislators when they intrude themselves into concerns for which their education has not fitted them <\s>
<s> the liberty of the press is a main support of the liberty of the nation it is a blessing which it is our duty to transmit to posterity but a bad use is sometimes made of it and its use is never more pernicious than when it is employed to infuse into the minds of the lowest orders of the community disparaging ideas concerning the constitution of their country <\s>
<s> no danger need be apprehended from a candid examination of our own constitution or from a display of the advantages of any other it will bear to be contrasted with the best but all men are not qualified to make the comparison and there are so many men in every community who wish to have no government at all that an appeal to them on such a point ought never to be made <\s>

<s> the greatest freedom that can be enjoyed by man in a state of civil society the greatest security that can be given him with respect to the protection of his character property personal liberty limb and life is afforded to every individual by our present constitution <\s>
<s> the equality of men in a state of nature does not consist in an equality of bodily strength or intellectual ability but in their being equally free from the dominion of each other <\s>
<s> the equality of men in a state of civil society does not consist in an equality of wisdom honesty ingenuity industry nor in an equality of property resulting from a due exertion of these talents but in being equally subject to equally protected by the same laws <\s>

<s> and you might as reasonably contend that the bramble ought to be equal to the oak the lamb to the lion as that no distinctions should take place between the members of the same society <\s>
<s> the burdens of the state are distributed through the whole community with as much impartiality as the complex nature of taxation will admit every man sustains a part in proportion to his strength no order is exempted from the payment of taxes <\s>

<s> other nations may deluge their land with blood in struggling for liberty and equality but let it never be forgotten by ourselves and let us impress the observation upon the hearts of our children that we are in possession of both of as much of both as can be consistent with the end for which civil society was introduced amongst mankind <\s>

<s> with regard to france i have no hesitation in declaring that the object which the french seemed to have in view at the commencement of their revolution had my hearty approbation <\s>
<s> the object was to free themselves and their posterity from arbitrary power <\s>
<s> i hope there is not a man in great britain so little sensible of the blessings of that free constitution under which he has the happiness to live so entirely dead to the interests of general humanity as not to wish that a constitution similar to our own might be established not only in france but in every despotic state in europe not only in europe but in every quarter of the globe <\s>
<s> it is one thing to approve of an end another to approve of the means by which an end is accomplished <\s>
<s> i did not approve of the means by which the first revolution was effected in france <\s>
<s> i thought that it would have been a wiser measure to have abridged the oppressive privileges and to have lessened the enormous number of the nobility than to have abolished the order <\s>
<s> i thought that the state ought not in justice to have seized any part of the property of the church till it had reverted as it were to the community by the death of its immediate possessors <\s>
<s> i thought that the king was not only treated with unmerited indignity but that too little authority was left him to enable him as the chief executive magistrate to be useful to the state <\s>
<s> these were some of my reasons for not approving the means by which the first revolution in france was brought about <\s>
<s> as to other evils which took place on the occasion i considered them certainly as evils of importance but at the same time as evils inseparable from a state of civil commotion and which i conceived would be more than compensated by the establishment of a limited monarchy <\s>
<s> the french have abandoned the constitution they had at first established and have changed it for another <\s>
<s> no one can reprobate with more truth than i do both the means and the end of this change <\s>
<s> the end has been the establishment of a republic <\s>
<s> now a republic is a form of government which of all others i most dislike and i dislike it for this reason because of all forms of government scarcely excepting the most despotic i think a republic the most oppressive to the bulk of the people they are deceived in it with the show of liberty but they live in it under the most odious of all tyrannies the tyranny of their equals <\s>
<s> with respect to the means by which this new republic has been erected in france they have been sanguinary savage more than brutal <\s>
<s> they not merely fill the heart of every individual with commiseration for the unfortunate sufferers but they exhibit to the eye of contemplation an humiliating picture of human nature when its passions are not regulated by religion or controlled by law <\s>
<s> i fly with terror and abhorrence even from the altar of liberty when i see it stained with the blood of the aged of the innocent of the defenceless sex of the ministers of religion and of the faithful adherents of a fallen monarch <\s>
<s> my heart sinks within me when i see it streaming with the blood of the monarch himself <\s>
<s> strike speedily we beseech thee with deep contrition and sincere remorse the obdurate hearts of the relentless perpetrators and projectors of these horrid deeds lest they should suddenly sink into eternal and extreme perdition loaded with an unutterable weight of unrepented and except through the blood of him whose religion they reject inexpiable sin <\s>
<s> the monarch you will tell me was guilty of perfidy and perjury <\s>
<s> i know not that he was guilty of either but admitting that he has been guilty of both who alas of the sons of men is so confident in the strength of his own virtue so assured of his own integrity and intrepidity of character as to be certain that under similar temptations he would not have been guilty of similar offences <\s>
<s> surely it would have been no diminution of the sternness of new republican virtue no disgrace to the magnanimity of a great nation if it had pardoned the perfidy which its own oppression had occasioned if it had remitted the punishment of the perjury of the king to the tribunal of him by whom kings reign and princes decree justice <\s>
<s> and are there any men in this kingdom except such as find their account in public confusion who would hazard the introduction of such scenes of rapine barbarity and bloodshed as have disgraced france and outraged humanity for the sake of obtaining what liberty and equality <\s>
<s> i suspect that the meaning of these terms is not clearly and generally understood it may be of use to explain them <\s>
<s> the liberty of a man in a state of nature consists in his being subject to no law but the law of nature and the liberty of a man in a state of society consists in his being subject to no law but to the law enacted by the general will of the society to which he belongs <\s>
<s> and to what other law is any man in great britain subject <\s>
<s> the king we are all justly persuaded has not the inclination and we all know that if he had the inclination he has not the power to substitute his will in the place of the law <\s>
<s> the house of lords has no such power the house of commons has no such power the church has no such power the rich men of the country have no such power <\s>
<s> the poorest man amongst us the beggar at our door is governed not by the uncertain passionate arbitrary will of an individual not by the selfish insolence of an aristocratic faction not by the madness of democratic violence but by the fixed impartial deliberate voice of law enacted by the general suffrage of a free people <\s>
<s> is your property injured <\s>
<s> law indeed does not give you property but it ascertains it <\s>
<s> property is acquired by industry and probity by the exercise of talents and ingenuity and the possession of it is secured by the laws of the community <\s>
<s> against whom think you is it secured <\s>
<s> it is secured against thieves and robbers against idle and profligate men who however low your condition may be would be glad to deprive you of the little you possess <\s>
<s> it is secured not only against such disturbers of the public peace but against the oppression of the noble the rapacity of the powerful and the avarice of the rich <\s>
