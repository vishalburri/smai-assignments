<s> he extended his range of view to events in foreign parts especially on the continent of europe <\s>
<s> few persons though actually engaged in the great struggle of that period felt more deeply than wordsworth did in his peaceful retreat for the calamities of european nations suffering at that time from the imbecility of their governments and from the withering oppression of a prosperous despotism <\s>
<s> his heart burned within him when he looked forth upon the contest and impassioned words proceeded from him both in poetry and prose <\s>
<s> the contemplative calmness of his position and the depth and intensity of his feelings combined together to give a dignity and clearness a vigour and splendour and consequently a lasting value to his writings on measures of domestic and foreign policy qualities that rarely belong to contemporaneous political effusions produced by those engaged in the heat and din of the battle <\s>
<s> this remark is specially applicable to his tract on the convention of cintra .... <\s>
<s> whatever difference of opinion may prevail concerning the relevance of the great principles enunciated in it to the questions at issue but one judgment can exist with respect to the importance of those principles and the vigorous and fervid eloquence with which they are enforced <\s>
<s> if wordsworth had never written a single verse this essay alone would be sufficient to place him in the highest rank of english poets .... <\s>
<s> enough has been quoted to show that the essay on the convention of cintra was not an ephemeral production destined to vanish with the occasion which gave it birth <\s>
<s> if this were the case the labour bestowed upon it was almost abortive <\s>
<s> the author composed the work in the discharge of what he regarded a sacred duty and for the permanent benefit of society rather than with a view to any immediate results 5 the bishop adds further these details he foresaw and predicted that his words would be to the public ear what midnight storms are to men who sleep 5 memoirs as before vol <\s>

<s> certain it is that an edition consisting only of five hundred copies was not sold off that many copies were disposed of by the publishers as waste paper and went to the trunkmakers and now there is scarcely any volume published in this country which is so difficult to be met with as the tract on the convention of cintra and if it were now reprinted it would come before the public with almost the unimpaired freshness of a new work [8 in agreement with the closing statement at the sale of the library of sir james macintosh a copy fetched it has been reported ten guineas <\s>

<s> though wordsworth agreed that we ought to step forward with all our military force as principals in the war he objected to any increase of our own power and resources by continental conquest in which i now think he was quite right <\s>
<s> i am not however by any means shaken in the opinion then advanced that peace with napoleon would lead to the loss of our naval superiority and of our national independence ... <\s>
<s> and i fully believe that the duke of wellington's campaigns in the spanish peninsula saved the nation though no less credit is due to the ministry of that day for not despairing of eventual success but supporting him under all difficulties in spite of temporary reverses and in opposition to a powerful party and to influential writers <\s>

<s> as cato owed lucan's panegyric to the firmness he had shown in adhering to the losing cause and to his steadfastness to the principles he had adopted so i considered the bishop's application of the lines to me as highly complimentary life and times vol <\s>
<s> it seemed only due to the subject of wordsworth's invective and opposition to give his view of the struggle and another's worthy of all respect <\s>
<s> unless the writer has been misinformed wordsworth and brougham came to know and worthily estimate each other when the exacerbations and clamours of provincial politics had long passed away and when except the old gray head of wellington none received more reverence from the nation than that of henry brougham <\s>

<s> but with all abatements these two addresses supply much material for a right and high estimate of wordsworth as man and thinker <\s>
<s> as invariably he descends to the roots of things and almost ennobles even his prejudices and alarms and ultra caution <\s>

<s> if at this later day for even 1829 seems remote now much of the present letter to the bishop of london blomfield is mainly of historical noticeableness as revealing how catholic emancipation looked to one of the foremost minds of his age there are nevertheless expressions of personal opinion e g against the athanasian creed in its cursing clauses and expositions of the papacy regarded politically and ecclesiastically in its domination of ireland that have a message for to day strangely congruous with that of the magnificent philippic of the vatican decrees which is thundering across europe as these words are written <\s>
