<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>
<s> by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into number alternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers <\s>
<s> recur to the passage already cited from milton <\s>
<s> when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala <\s>
<s> they i e the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one body the point from which the comparison set out <\s>
<s> so seemed and to whom seemed <\s>
<s> to the heavenly muse who dictates the poem to the eye of the poet's mind and to that of the reader present at one moment in the wide ethiopian and the next in the solitudes then first broken in upon of the infernal regions <\s>
<s> modo me thebis modo ponit athenis <\s>
<s> here again this mighty poet speaking of the messiah going forth to expel from heaven the rebellious angels attended by ten thousand thousand saints he onward came far off his coming shone the retinue of saints and the person of the messiah himself lost almost and merged in the splendour of that indefinite abstraction his coming <\s>
<s> as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect 18 the grand store houses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser <\s>

<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>

<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>

<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>
<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>
<s> this arrangement has long presented itself habitually to my own mind <\s>
<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>

<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>

<s> as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect 18 the grand store houses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser <\s>

<s> 1815 d of poetry as observation and description <\s>
<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>

<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>
<s> by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into number alternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers <\s>
<s> recur to the passage already cited from milton <\s>
<s> when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala <\s>
<s> they i e the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one body the point from which the comparison set out <\s>
<s> so seemed and to whom seemed <\s>

<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>

<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>

<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>
<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>
<s> this arrangement has long presented itself habitually to my own mind <\s>
<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>

<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>

<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>

<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>

<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>

<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>

<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>

<s> as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect 18 the grand store houses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser <\s>

<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>

<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>

<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>

<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>

<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>

<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>

<s> 1815 d of poetry as observation and description <\s>
<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>
<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>

<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>

<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>
<s> by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into number alternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers <\s>
<s> recur to the passage already cited from milton <\s>
<s> when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala <\s>
<s> they i e the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one body the point from which the comparison set out <\s>
<s> so seemed and to whom seemed <\s>
<s> to the heavenly muse who dictates the poem to the eye of the poet's mind and to that of the reader present at one moment in the wide ethiopian and the next in the solitudes then first broken in upon of the infernal regions <\s>
<s> modo me thebis modo ponit athenis <\s>
<s> here again this mighty poet speaking of the messiah going forth to expel from heaven the rebellious angels attended by ten thousand thousand saints he onward came far off his coming shone the retinue of saints and the person of the messiah himself lost almost and merged in the splendour of that indefinite abstraction his coming <\s>
<s> as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect 18 the grand store houses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser <\s>
<s> i select these writers in preference to those of ancient greece and rome because the anthropomorphitism of the pagan religion subjected the minds of the greatest poets in those countries too much to the bondage of definite form from which the hebrews were preserved by their abhorrence of idolatry <\s>
<s> the thought is most injurious and could the charge be brought against him he would repel it with indignation <\s>
<s> the people have already been justified and their eulogium pronounced by implication when it was said above that of good poetry the individual as well as the species survives <\s>
<s> and how does it survive but through the people <\s>
<s> what preserves it but their intellect and their wisdom <\s>
<s> past and future are the wings on whose support harmoniously conjoined moves the great spirit of human knowledge ms <\s>
<s> the voice that issues from this spirit is that vox populi which the deity inspires <\s>
<s> foolish must he be who can mistake for this a local acclamation or a transitory outcry transitory though it be for years local though from a nation <\s>
<s> still more lamentable is his error who can believe that there is any thing of divine infallibility in the clamour of that small though loud portion of the community ever governed by factitious influence which under the name of the public passes itself upon the unthinking for the people <\s>
<s> towards the public the writer hopes that he feels as much deference as it is entitled to but to the people philosophically characterised and to the embodied spirit of their knowledge so far as it exists and moves at the present faithfully supported by its two wings the past and the future his devout respect his reverence is due <\s>
<s> he offers it willingly and readily and this done takes leave of his readers by assuring them that if he were not persuaded that the contents of these volumes and the work to which they are subsidiary evince something of the vision and the faculty divine and that both in words and things they will operate in their degree to extend the domain of sensibility for the delight the honour and the benefit of human nature notwithstanding the many happy hours which he has employed in their composition and the manifold comforts and enjoyments they have procured to him he would not if a wish could do it save them from immediate destruction from becoming at this moment to the world as a thing that had never been <\s>

<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>

<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>

<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>
<s> this arrangement has long presented itself habitually to my own mind <\s>
<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>

<s> 1815 d of poetry as observation and description <\s>
<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>

<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>
<s> by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into number alternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers <\s>
<s> recur to the passage already cited from milton <\s>
<s> when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala <\s>
<s> they i e the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one body the point from which the comparison set out <\s>
<s> so seemed and to whom seemed <\s>
<s> to the heavenly muse who dictates the poem to the eye of the poet's mind and to that of the reader present at one moment in the wide ethiopian and the next in the solitudes then first broken in upon of the infernal regions <\s>
<s> modo me thebis modo ponit athenis <\s>
<s> here again this mighty poet speaking of the messiah going forth to expel from heaven the rebellious angels attended by ten thousand thousand saints he onward came far off his coming shone the retinue of saints and the person of the messiah himself lost almost and merged in the splendour of that indefinite abstraction his coming <\s>
<s> as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect 18 the grand store houses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser <\s>

<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>

<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>

<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>
<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>
<s> this arrangement has long presented itself habitually to my own mind <\s>
<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>

<s> 1815 d of poetry as observation and description <\s>
<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>

<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>
<s> by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into number alternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers <\s>
<s> recur to the passage already cited from milton <\s>
<s> when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala <\s>
<s> they i e the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one body the point from which the comparison set out <\s>
<s> so seemed and to whom seemed <\s>
<s> to the heavenly muse who dictates the poem to the eye of the poet's mind and to that of the reader present at one moment in the wide ethiopian and the next in the solitudes then first broken in upon of the infernal regions <\s>
<s> modo me thebis modo ponit athenis <\s>
<s> here again this mighty poet speaking of the messiah going forth to expel from heaven the rebellious angels attended by ten thousand thousand saints he onward came far off his coming shone the retinue of saints and the person of the messiah himself lost almost and merged in the splendour of that indefinite abstraction his coming <\s>
<s> as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect 18 the grand store houses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser <\s>

<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>

<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>

<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>
<s> by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into number alternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers <\s>
<s> recur to the passage already cited from milton <\s>
<s> when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala <\s>
<s> they i e the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one body the point from which the comparison set out <\s>
<s> so seemed and to whom seemed <\s>
<s> to the heavenly muse who dictates the poem to the eye of the poet's mind and to that of the reader present at one moment in the wide ethiopian and the next in the solitudes then first broken in upon of the infernal regions <\s>

<s> here again this mighty poet speaking of the messiah going forth to expel from heaven the rebellious angels attended by ten thousand thousand saints he onward came far off his coming shone the retinue of saints and the person of the messiah himself lost almost and merged in the splendour of that indefinite abstraction his coming <\s>

<s> 1815 d of poetry as observation and description <\s>
<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>
<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>
<s> this arrangement has long presented itself habitually to my own mind <\s>
<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>

<s> 1815 d of poetry as observation and description <\s>
<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>

<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>
<s> by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into number alternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers <\s>
<s> recur to the passage already cited from milton <\s>
<s> when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala <\s>
<s> they i e the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one body the point from which the comparison set out <\s>
<s> so seemed and to whom seemed <\s>

<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>

<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>

<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>
<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>
<s> this arrangement has long presented itself habitually to my own mind <\s>
<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>

<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>

<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>

<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>

<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>

<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>

<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>

<s> as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect 18 the grand store houses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser <\s>

<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>

<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>

<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>

<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>

<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>

<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>

<s> 1815 d of poetry as observation and description <\s>
<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>
<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>

<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>

<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>
<s> by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into number alternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers <\s>
<s> recur to the passage already cited from milton <\s>
<s> when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala <\s>
<s> they i e the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one body the point from which the comparison set out <\s>
<s> so seemed and to whom seemed <\s>
<s> to the heavenly muse who dictates the poem to the eye of the poet's mind and to that of the reader present at one moment in the wide ethiopian and the next in the solitudes then first broken in upon of the infernal regions <\s>
<s> modo me thebis modo ponit athenis <\s>
<s> here again this mighty poet speaking of the messiah going forth to expel from heaven the rebellious angels attended by ten thousand thousand saints he onward came far off his coming shone the retinue of saints and the person of the messiah himself lost almost and merged in the splendour of that indefinite abstraction his coming <\s>
<s> as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect 18 the grand store houses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser <\s>
<s> i select these writers in preference to those of ancient greece and rome because the anthropomorphitism of the pagan religion subjected the minds of the greatest poets in those countries too much to the bondage of definite form from which the hebrews were preserved by their abhorrence of idolatry <\s>
<s> the thought is most injurious and could the charge be brought against him he would repel it with indignation <\s>
<s> the people have already been justified and their eulogium pronounced by implication when it was said above that of good poetry the individual as well as the species survives <\s>
<s> and how does it survive but through the people <\s>
<s> what preserves it but their intellect and their wisdom <\s>
<s> past and future are the wings on whose support harmoniously conjoined moves the great spirit of human knowledge ms <\s>
<s> the voice that issues from this spirit is that vox populi which the deity inspires <\s>
<s> foolish must he be who can mistake for this a local acclamation or a transitory outcry transitory though it be for years local though from a nation <\s>
<s> still more lamentable is his error who can believe that there is any thing of divine infallibility in the clamour of that small though loud portion of the community ever governed by factitious influence which under the name of the public passes itself upon the unthinking for the people <\s>
<s> towards the public the writer hopes that he feels as much deference as it is entitled to but to the people philosophically characterised and to the embodied spirit of their knowledge so far as it exists and moves at the present faithfully supported by its two wings the past and the future his devout respect his reverence is due <\s>
<s> he offers it willingly and readily and this done takes leave of his readers by assuring them that if he were not persuaded that the contents of these volumes and the work to which they are subsidiary evince something of the vision and the faculty divine and that both in words and things they will operate in their degree to extend the domain of sensibility for the delight the honour and the benefit of human nature notwithstanding the many happy hours which he has employed in their composition and the manifold comforts and enjoyments they have procured to him he would not if a wish could do it save them from immediate destruction from becoming at this moment to the world as a thing that had never been <\s>

<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>

<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>

<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>
<s> this arrangement has long presented itself habitually to my own mind <\s>
<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>

<s> 1815 d of poetry as observation and description <\s>
<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>

<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>
<s> i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other <\s>
<s> the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security <\s>
<s> take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other <\s>
<s> as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea beast crawled forth which on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself <\s>
<s> such seemed this man not all alive or dead nor all asleep in his extreme old age <\s>
<s> motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth altogether if it move at all <\s>
<s> in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction <\s>
<s> the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the sea beast and the sea beast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison <\s>
<s> after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon <\s>
<s> thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how <\s>
<s> by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into number alternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers <\s>
<s> recur to the passage already cited from milton <\s>
<s> when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala <\s>
<s> they i e the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one body the point from which the comparison set out <\s>
<s> so seemed and to whom seemed <\s>
<s> to the heavenly muse who dictates the poem to the eye of the poet's mind and to that of the reader present at one moment in the wide ethiopian and the next in the solitudes then first broken in upon of the infernal regions <\s>
<s> modo me thebis modo ponit athenis <\s>
<s> here again this mighty poet speaking of the messiah going forth to expel from heaven the rebellious angels attended by ten thousand thousand saints he onward came far off his coming shone the retinue of saints and the person of the messiah himself lost almost and merged in the splendour of that indefinite abstraction his coming <\s>
<s> as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect 18 the grand store houses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser <\s>

<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>
<s> the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind <\s>
<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
<s> the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations produced british synonyms discriminated by w <\s>
<s> is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure <\s>
<s> here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious author's mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him <\s>
<s> it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory <\s>
<s> if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity <\s>
<s> imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws <\s>
<s> i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances <\s>
<s> a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail <\s>
<s> each creature does so literally and actually <\s>
<s> in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo <\s>
<s> half way down hangs one who gathers samphire is the well known expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover <\s>
<s> in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphire gatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging <\s>
<s> as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend <\s>
<s> here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared <\s>
<s> from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes over his own sweet voice the stock dove broods of the same bird his voice was buried among trees <\s>
<s> yet to be come at by the breeze o cuckoo <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> the stock dove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation <\s>
<s> his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener <\s>
<s> shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice <\s>
<s> this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight <\s>
<s> thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious <\s>
<s> these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to re act upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence <\s>

<s> 1815 d of poetry as observation and description <\s>
<s> the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and description i e the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory <\s>
<s> this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original <\s>
<s> 2ndly sensibility which the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poet's perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as re acted upon by his own mind <\s>
<s> the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflection which makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other <\s>
<s> 4thly imagination and fancy to modify to create and to associate <\s>
<s> 5thly invention by which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poet's own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate <\s>
<s> and lastly judgment to decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due <\s>
<s> by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition 17 17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites <\s>
<s> the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms <\s>
<s> the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order <\s>
<s> 1st the narrative including the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mock heroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel <\s>
<s> of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows <\s>
<s> epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted <\s>
<s> the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their tale so that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music <\s>
<s> 2ndly the dramatic consisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely <\s>
<s> the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical <\s>
<s> the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class <\s>
<s> 3dly the lyrical containing the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable <\s>
<s> 4thly the idyllium descriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstone's schoolmistress the cotter's saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beattie's minstrel goldsmith's deserted village <\s>
<s> the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all loco descriptive poetry belong to this class <\s>
<s> 5thly didactic the principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer mason's english garden c <\s>
<s> and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry <\s>
<s> out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which young's night thoughts and cowper's task are excellent examples <\s>
<s> it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate <\s>
<s> from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality <\s>
<s> my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse <\s>
<s> this arrangement has long presented itself habitually to my own mind <\s>
<s> nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader <\s>
<s> i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general <\s>
<s> but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the author's conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree <\s>
<s> where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice vers ?? <\s>
<s> both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout <\s>
<s> none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice <\s>
<s> but a remark of general application may be made <\s>
<s> all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine <\s>
<s> for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the reader's charity <\s>
<s> some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject <\s>
<s> poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexible the letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versification as to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poem in the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images <\s>
<s> but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman he murmurs near the running brooks a music sweeter than their own <\s>
<s> let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems <\s>
<s> a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation <\s>
<s> a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects <\s>
<s> imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining <\s>

<s> the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised <\s>
