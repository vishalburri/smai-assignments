<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>

<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>

<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>

<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>

<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>

<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>

<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>

<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>

<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>

<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>

<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>

<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>

<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>

<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>

<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>

<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>

<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>
<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>

<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>
<s> let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few <\s>
<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>
<s> this is already done by their works in the memories of men <\s>
<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>
<s> what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones the labour of an age in piled stones or that his hallowed reliques should be hid under a star y pointing pyramid <\s>
<s> dear son of memory great heir of fame what need'st thou such weak witness of thy name <\s>
<s> thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a livelong monument and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie that kings for such a tomb would wish to die <\s>
<s> b the country church yard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs <\s>
<s> from the author's mss yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh <\s>
<s> their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die <\s>
<s> when a stranger has walked round a country church yard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tomb stones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried <\s>

<s> but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to all to the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn book the child is proud that he can read it and the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for all in the church yard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it <\s>
<s> yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent also liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice <\s>
<s> the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary <\s>
<s> seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted <\s>
<s> moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended <\s>
<s> the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem <\s>
<s> these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tomb stone <\s>
<s> the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer <\s>
<s> he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate <\s>
<s> thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised <\s>
<s> by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do <\s>
<s> this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source <\s>
<s> i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode <\s>
<s> and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood <\s>
<s> this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the ground work of the other it rests upon a more solid basis <\s>
<s> enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition <\s>
<s> according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory <\s>
<s> nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude <\s>
<s> yet i must here pause to correct myself <\s>
<s> in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it <\s>
<s> having made this necessary distinction i proceed the mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them <\s>

<s> their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admiration or the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtue or a declaration touching that pious humility and self abasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltation or an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual power these are the only tribute which can here be paid the only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy <\s>

<s> he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon <\s>
<s> for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented <\s>
<s> and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging <\s>
<s> amid the quiet of a church yard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summer's day <\s>
<s> it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude <\s>
<s> i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated <\s>
<s> the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that sea with accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariner's hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream <\s>
<s> nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all <\s>
<s> without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village church yard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described <\s>
<s> for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences <\s>
<s> drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them <\s>
<s> but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked <\s>
<s> industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves <\s>
<s> the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stifle this is all a labour of privacy <\s>
<s> in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess <\s>
<s> this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly <\s>
<s> it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in self forgetfulness and humility <\s>
<s> that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth <\s>
<s> i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tomb stones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed <\s>
<s> doubtless an inattentive or ill disposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly <\s>
<s> much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations <\s>
<s> besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable <\s>
<s> enter a church yard by the sea coast and you will be almost sure to find the tomb stones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a sea faring life <\s>
<s> these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety <\s>
<s> would not the contrary conclusion be right <\s>
<s> but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred <\s>
<s> we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another <\s>
<s> strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction <\s>
<s> nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their church yard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists <\s>
<s> for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote <\s>
<s> finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him <\s>
<s> an experienced and well regulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth <\s>
<s> yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented <\s>
<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
<s> no the thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered <\s>
<s> the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven <\s>
<s> it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented <\s>
<s> any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusion either that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold <\s>
<s> and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless <\s>
<s> much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly <\s>
<s> for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low <\s>
<s> we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness good will justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all <\s>

<s> this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a church yard in germany thus literally translated ah <\s>
<s> they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many <\s>
<s> sie haben einen braven mann begraben mir war er mehr als viele <\s>
<s> an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed <\s>
<s> and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed <\s>
<s> every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations <\s>
<s> i will however give one or two from an old book cited before <\s>
<s> the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man i am departed hens and so sal ye but in this passage the best song i can is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me <\s>
<s> when i have ended all myn adversity grant me in paradys to have a mansion that shedst thy bloud for my redemption <\s>
<s> this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioress's tale <\s>
<s> the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a church yard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression <\s>
<s> when the bells be mearely roung and the masse devoutly soung and the meate merrely eaten then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be forgotten <\s>
<s> wherfor iesu that of mary sproung set their soulys thy saynts among though it be undeservyd on their syde yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde <\s>
<s> it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense <\s>
<s> the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged <\s>
<s> it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious <\s>
<s> it is upon a man whose name was palmer <\s>
<s> i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the reader's gratification <\s>
<s> palmers all our fathers were i a palmer livèd here and travelled still till worn with age i ended this world's pilgrimage on the blest ascension day in the chearful month of may one thousand with four hundred seven and took my journey hence to heaven <\s>
<s> with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st <\s>
<s> hic quidem terra tegitur peccati solvens debitum cujus nomen non impositum in libro vitae sit inscriptum <\s>
<s> the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life <\s>
<s> but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplations a country church yard <\s>
<s> and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it <\s>
<s> i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation <\s>
<s> with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes <\s>
<s> these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to good humoured laughter <\s>
