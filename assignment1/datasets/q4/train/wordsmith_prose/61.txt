<s> this poem was composed at coleorton while i was walking to and fro along the path that led from sir george beaumont's farm house where we resided to the hall which was building at that time <\s>
<s> earth helped him with the cry of blood l <\s>
<s> this line is from the battle of bosworth field by sir john beaumont brother to the dramatist whose poems are written with much spirit elegance and harmony and have deservedly been reprinted in chalmers collection of english poets <\s>
<s> the undying fish of bowscale tarn l <\s>
<s> it is believed by the people of the country that there are two immortal fish inhabitants of this tarn which lies in the mountains not far from threlkeld blencathara mentioned before is the old and proper name of the mountain vulgarly called saddle back <\s>
<s> armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls ll <\s>
<s> the martial character of the cliffords is well known to the readers of english history but it may not be improper here to say by way of comment on these lines and what follows that besides several others who perished in the same manner the four immediate progenitors of the person in whose hearing this is supposed to be spoken all died on the field <\s>
<s> no poem of mine was composed under circumstances more pleasant for me to remember than this <\s>
<s> i began it upon leaving tintern after crossing the wye and concluded it just as i was entering bristol in the evening after a ramble of four or five days with my sister <\s>
<s> not a line of it was altered and not any part of it written down till i reached bristol <\s>
<s> it was published almost immediately after in the little volume of which so much has been said in these notes the lyrical ballads as first published at bristol by cottle <\s>
<s> it is no spirit c xxvii 1803 <\s>
<s> i remember the instant my sister sarah hutchinson called me to the window of our cottage saying look how beautiful is yon star <\s>
<s> it has the sky all to itself <\s>
<s> i composed the verses immediately <\s>
<s> xxviii an extract from the long poem on my own poetical education <\s>
<s> it was first published by coleridge in his friend which is the reason of its having had a place in every edition of my poems since <\s>
<s> yes it was the mountain echo <\s>
<s> the echo came from nabscar when i was walking on the opposite side of rydal mere <\s>
<s> i will here mention for my dear sister's sake that while she was sitting alone one day high up on this part of loughrigg fell she was so affected by the voice of the cuckoo heard from the crags at some distance that she could not suppress a wish to have a stone inscribed with her name among the rocks from which the sound proceeded <\s>
<s> on my return from my walk i recited those verses to mary who was then confined with her son thomas who died in his seventh year as recorded on his headstone in grasmere churchyard <\s>
<s> xxx rydal mount 1825 <\s>
<s> in pencil where there are no skylarks but the poet is everywhere 159 <\s>
<s> xxxi rydal mount 1814 <\s>
<s> written at the same time as dion and artegal and elidure <\s>
<s> the incident of the trees growing and withering put the subject into my thoughts and i wrote with the hope of giving it a loftier tone than so far as i know has been given it by any of the ancients who have treated of it <\s>
<s> it cost me more trouble than almost anything of equal length i have ever written <\s>
<s> the trees tall summits withered at the sight l <\s>
<s> for the account of long lived trees see king's natural history lib <\s>
<s> 44 and for the features in the character of protesilaus see the iphigenia in aulis of euripides <\s>
<s> xxxii this poem was first introduced by a stanza that i have since transferred to the notes for reasons there given and i cannot comply with the request expressed by some of my friends that the rejected stanza should be restored <\s>
<s> i hope they will be content if it be hereafter immediately attached to the poem instead of its being degraded to a place in the notes <\s>
<s> the reasons supra are thus given this poem began with the following stanza which has been displaced on account of its detaining the reader too long from the subject and as rather precluding than preparing for the due effect of the allusion to the genius of plato <\s>
<s> fair is the swan c xxxiii see supra 161 163 <\s>
<s> the pass of kirkstone <\s>
<s> thoughts and feelings of many walks in all weathers by day and night over this pass alone and with beloved friends <\s>
<s> xxxv rydal mount 1816 <\s>
<s> the lady was miss blackett then residing with mr <\s>
<s> montague burgoyne at fox ghyll <\s>
<s> we were tempted to remain too long upon the mountain and i imprudently with the hope of shortening the way led her among the crags and down a steep slope which entangled us in difficulties that were met by her with much spirit and courage <\s>
<s> to a young lady <\s>
<s> xxxvi composed at the same time and on the same vein as i met louisa in the shade <\s>
<s> indeed they were designed to make one piece <\s>
<s> xxxvii observed frequently over the lakes of rydal and grasmere <\s>
<s> view from the top of black comb <\s>
<s> mary and i as mentioned in the epistle to sir g <\s>
<s> beaumont lived some time under its shadow <\s>
<s> this tree grew in the park of rydal and i have often listened to its creaking as described <\s>
<s> xl rydal mount 1828 <\s>
<s> the girls edith mary southey my daughter dora and sarah coleridge <\s>
<s> more fully on this and others contemporaneously written is the following letter to g h <\s>
<s> how strange that any one should be puzzled with the name triad after reading the poem <\s>
<s> i have turned to dr <\s>
<s> johnson and there find triad three united and not a word more as nothing more was needed <\s>
<s> i should have been rather mortified if you had not liked the piece as i think it contains some of the happiest verses i ever wrote <\s>
<s> it had been promised several years to two of the party before a fancy fit for the performance struck me it was then thrown off rapidly and afterwards revised with care <\s>
<s> during the last week i wrote some stanzas on the power of sound which ought to find a place in my larger work if aught should ever come of that <\s>
<s> in the book on the lakes which i have not at hand is a passage rather too vaguely expressed where i content myself with saying that after a certain point of elevation the effect of mountains depends much more upon their form than upon their absolute height <\s>
<s> this point which ought to have been defined is the one to which fleecy clouds not thin watery vapours are accustomed to descend <\s>
<s> i am glad you are so much interested with this little tract it could not have been written without long experience <\s>
<s> i remain most faithfully your much obliged william wordsworth <\s>
<s> xli in the vale of grasmere by the side of the old highway leading to ambleside is a gate which time out of mind has been called the wishing gate from a belief that wishes formed or indulged there have a favourable issue <\s>
<s> having been told upon what i thought good authority that this gate had been destroyed and the opening where it hung walled up i gave vent immediately to my feelings in these stanzas <\s>
<s> but going to the place some time after i found with much delight my old favourite unmolested <\s>
<s> rydal mount 1828 172 <\s>
<s> the primrose of the rock <\s>
<s> xliii rydal mount 1821 <\s>
<s> it stands on the right hand a little way leading up the vale from grasmere to rydal <\s>
<s> we have been in the habit of calling it the glow worm rock from the number of glow worms we have often seen hanging on it as described <\s>
<s> the tuft of primrose has i fear been washed away by heavy rains <\s>
<s> xliv rydal mount 1830 <\s>
<s> xlv rydal mount 1817 <\s>
<s> composed to place in view the immortality of succession where immortality is denied so far as we know to the individual creature <\s>
<s> xlvi rydal mount 1832 <\s>
<s> xlvii of this clock i have nothing further to say than what the poem expresses except that it must be here recorded that it was a present from the dear friend for whose sake these notes were chiefly undertaken and who has written them from my dictation <\s>
