<s> it is interesting too on another account as being the residence of the poet wordsworth his house is about a quarter of a mile from ours and since osler joined us we have obtained an introduction to him and he favoured us with his company at tea one evening last week <\s>
<s> he is a very interesting man remarkably simple in his manners full of enthusiasm and eloquence in conversation especially on the subject of his favourite art poetry which he seems to have studied in a very philosophical spirit and about which he entertains some peculiar opinions <\s>

<s> he has a good deal of general conversation and has more the manners of a man of the world than i should have expected from his poems but his discourse indicates great simplicity and purity of mind indeed nothing renders his conversation more interesting than the unaffected tone of elevated morality and devotion which pervades it <\s>
<s> we have been reading his long poem the excursion since we came here <\s>
<s> i particularly recommend it to your notice barring some few extra vagancies into which his peculiar theory has led him his fourth book the last contains specimens both of versification sentiment and imagery scarcely inferior to what you will find in the best passages of milton <\s>

<s> as early as 1824 walter savage landor in his imaginary conversation between southey and porson had pronounced wordsworth's laodamia to be a composition such as sophocles might have exulted to own and a part of which might have been heard with shouts of rapture in the regions he describes' the elysian fields <\s>

<s> i made a sign to edmund to hand him the cutlets a second time <\s>
<s> i was afraid he would stick his fork into that beautiful woman who sat next him <\s>
<s> wordsworth never resented a jest at his own expense <\s>
<s> once when we had knocked three times in vain at the door of a london house i exclaimed quoting his sonnet written on westminster bridge dear god the very houses seem asleep <\s>

<s> he did not recite more than a part of it to the accompaniment of distant cab and carriage and i thought that the door was opened too soon <\s>
<s> wordsworth despite his dislike to great cities was attracted occasionally in his later years to the proud margin of the thames and lambeth's venerable towers where his society was courted by persons of the most different character <\s>

<s> it is interesting too on another account as being the residence of the poet wordsworth his house is about a quarter of a mile from ours and since osler joined us we have obtained an introduction to him and he favoured us with his company at tea one evening last week <\s>
<s> he is a very interesting man remarkably simple in his manners full of enthusiasm and eloquence in conversation especially on the subject of his favourite art poetry which he seems to have studied in a very philosophical spirit and about which he entertains some peculiar opinions <\s>
<s> spenser shakspeare and milton are his favourites among the english poets especially the latter whom he almost idolises <\s>

<s> he is toryish at least what would he considered so in his political principles though he disclaims all connection with party and certainly argues with great fairness and temper on controverted topics such as parliamentary reform and catholic emancipation <\s>
<s> we took a long walk with him the other evening to the scene of one of his pastorals in the neighbourhood of grasmere <\s>
<s> he has a good deal of general conversation and has more the manners of a man of the world than i should have expected from his poems but his discourse indicates great simplicity and purity of mind indeed nothing renders his conversation more interesting than the unaffected tone of elevated morality and devotion which pervades it <\s>
<s> we have been reading his long poem the excursion since we came here <\s>
<s> i particularly recommend it to your notice barring some few extra vagancies into which his peculiar theory has led him his fourth book the last contains specimens both of versification sentiment and imagery scarcely inferior to what you will find in the best passages of milton <\s>
<s> he spoke with great plainness and yet with candour of his contemporaries <\s>
<s> the ready sympathies and inexperienced imagination of youth make it surrender itself easily despite its better aspirations or in consequence of them to a false greatness and the true greatness once revealed sets it free <\s>
<s> as early as 1824 walter savage landor in his imaginary conversation between southey and porson had pronounced wordsworth's laodamia to be a composition such as sophocles might have exulted to own and a part of which might have been heard with shouts of rapture in the regions he describes' the elysian fields <\s>
<s> wordsworth frequently spoke of death as if it were the taking of a new degree in the university of life <\s>
<s> i should like he remarked to a young lady to visit italy again before i move to another planet <\s>
<s> he sometimes made a mistake in assuming that others were equally philosophical <\s>
<s> we were once breakfasting at the house of mr <\s>

<s> rogers i never see this house so perfect in its taste so exquisite in all its arrangements and decorated with such well chosen pictures without fancying it the very house imaged to himself by the roman poet when in illustration of man's mortality he says linquenda est domus what is that you are saying <\s>
<s> rogers whose years between eighty and ninety had not improved his hearing <\s>
<s> i was remarking that your house replied wordsworth always reminds me of the ode more properly called an elegy though doubtless the lyrical measure not unnaturally causes it to be included among horace's odes in which the roman poet writes linquenda est domus that is since ladies being present a translation may be deemed desirable the house is or has to be left and again et placens uxor and the pleasing wife though as we must all regret that part of the quotation is not applicable on the present occasion <\s>

<s> his answer was what children call making a great face and the ejaculation don't talk latin in the society of ladies <\s>
<s> when i was going away he remarked what a stimulus the mountain air has on the appetite <\s>
<s> i made a sign to edmund to hand him the cutlets a second time <\s>
<s> i was afraid he would stick his fork into that beautiful woman who sat next him <\s>
<s> wordsworth never resented a jest at his own expense <\s>
<s> once when we had knocked three times in vain at the door of a london house i exclaimed quoting his sonnet written on westminster bridge dear god the very houses seem asleep <\s>
<s> he laughed heartily then smiled gravely and lastly recounted the occasion and described the early morning on which that sonnet was written <\s>
<s> he did not recite more than a part of it to the accompaniment of distant cab and carriage and i thought that the door was opened too soon <\s>
<s> wordsworth despite his dislike to great cities was attracted occasionally in his later years to the proud margin of the thames and lambeth's venerable towers where his society was courted by persons of the most different character <\s>
<s> but he complained bitterly of the great city <\s>
<s> it was next to impossible he remarked to tell the truth in it <\s>
<s> yesterday i was at s <\s>

<s> it is too bad that when more than seventy years old i should be brought from the mountains to london in order to tell a lie <\s>
<s> he made his complaint wherever he went laying the blame however not so much on himself or on the duchess as on the corrupt city and some of those who learned how the most truthful man in england had thus quickly been subverted by metropolitan snares came to the conclusion that within a few years more no virtue would be left extant in the land <\s>
<s> he was likewise maltreated in lesser ways <\s>
<s> this morning i was compelled by my engagements to eat three breakfasts one with an aged and excellent gentleman who may justly be esteemed an accomplished man of letters although i cannot honestly concede to him the title of a poet one at a fashionable party and one with an old friend whom no pressure would induce me to neglect although for this my first breakfast to day i was obliged to name the early hour of seven o'clock as he lives in a remote part of london <\s>
<s> but it was only among his own mountains that wordsworth could be understood <\s>

<s> if it rained he might fling his plaid over him but would take no admonition <\s>
<s> he must have his way <\s>
<s> on such occasions dutiful as he was in higher matters he remained incurably wayward <\s>
<s> in vain one reminded him that a letter needed an answer or that the storm would soon be over <\s>
<s> it was very necessary for him to do what he liked and one of his dearest friends said to me with a smile of the most affectionate humour he wrote his ode to duty and then he had done with that matter <\s>
<s> this very innocent form of lawlessness corresponding with the classic expression indulge genio seemed to belong to his genius not less than the sympathetic reverence with which he looked up to the higher and universal laws <\s>

<s> he has a good deal of general conversation and has more the manners of a man of the world than i should have expected from his poems but his discourse indicates great simplicity and purity of mind indeed nothing renders his conversation more interesting than the unaffected tone of elevated morality and devotion which pervades it <\s>

<s> i particularly recommend it to your notice barring some few extra vagancies into which his peculiar theory has led him his fourth book the last contains specimens both of versification sentiment and imagery scarcely inferior to what you will find in the best passages of milton <\s>

<s> he has a good deal of general conversation and has more the manners of a man of the world than i should have expected from his poems but his discourse indicates great simplicity and purity of mind indeed nothing renders his conversation more interesting than the unaffected tone of elevated morality and devotion which pervades it <\s>

<s> i particularly recommend it to your notice barring some few extra vagancies into which his peculiar theory has led him his fourth book the last contains specimens both of versification sentiment and imagery scarcely inferior to what you will find in the best passages of milton <\s>

<s> once when we had knocked three times in vain at the door of a london house i exclaimed quoting his sonnet written on westminster bridge dear god the very houses seem asleep <\s>
<s> he laughed heartily then smiled gravely and lastly recounted the occasion and described the early morning on which that sonnet was written <\s>
<s> he did not recite more than a part of it to the accompaniment of distant cab and carriage and i thought that the door was opened too soon <\s>
<s> wordsworth despite his dislike to great cities was attracted occasionally in his later years to the proud margin of the thames and lambeth's venerable towers where his society was courted by persons of the most different character <\s>
<s> but he complained bitterly of the great city <\s>
<s> it was next to impossible he remarked to tell the truth in it <\s>
<s> yesterday i was at s <\s>
<s> house the duchess of s showing me the pictures observed this is the portrait of my brother naming him and it is considered very like <\s>
<s> to this i assented partly perhaps in absence of mind but partly i think with an impression that her grace's brother was probably a person whose face every one knew or was expected to know so that as i had never met him my answer was in fact a lie <\s>
<s> it is too bad that when more than seventy years old i should be brought from the mountains to london in order to tell a lie <\s>
<s> he made his complaint wherever he went laying the blame however not so much on himself or on the duchess as on the corrupt city and some of those who learned how the most truthful man in england had thus quickly been subverted by metropolitan snares came to the conclusion that within a few years more no virtue would be left extant in the land <\s>
<s> he was likewise maltreated in lesser ways <\s>
<s> this morning i was compelled by my engagements to eat three breakfasts one with an aged and excellent gentleman who may justly be esteemed an accomplished man of letters although i cannot honestly concede to him the title of a poet one at a fashionable party and one with an old friend whom no pressure would induce me to neglect although for this my first breakfast to day i was obliged to name the early hour of seven o'clock as he lives in a remote part of london <\s>
<s> but it was only among his own mountains that wordsworth could be understood <\s>
<s> he walked among them not so much to admire them as to converse with them <\s>
<s> they exchanged thoughts with him in sunshine or flying shadow giving him their own and accepting his <\s>
<s> day and night at all hours and in all weather he would face them <\s>
<s> if it rained he might fling his plaid over him but would take no admonition <\s>
<s> he must have his way <\s>
<s> on such occasions dutiful as he was in higher matters he remained incurably wayward <\s>
<s> in vain one reminded him that a letter needed an answer or that the storm would soon be over <\s>
<s> it was very necessary for him to do what he liked and one of his dearest friends said to me with a smile of the most affectionate humour he wrote his ode to duty and then he had done with that matter <\s>
<s> this very innocent form of lawlessness corresponding with the classic expression indulge genio seemed to belong to his genius not less than the sympathetic reverence with which he looked up to the higher and universal laws <\s>
<s> sometimes there was a battle between his reverence for nature and his reverence for other things <\s>
<s> the friend already alluded to was once remarking on his varying expressions of countenance <\s>
<s> that rough old face is capable of high and real beauty i have seen in it an expression quite of heavenly peace and contemplative delight as the may breeze came over him from the woods while he was slowly walking out of church on a sunday morning and when he had half emerged from the shadow <\s>
<s> a flippant person present inquired did you ever chance miss f to observe that heavenly expression on his countenance as he was walking into church on a fine may morning <\s>
<s> a laugh was the reply <\s>
<s> the ways of nature harmonised with his feelings in age as well as in youth <\s>
<s> he could understand no estrangement <\s>
<s> gathering a wreath of white thorn on one occasion he murmured as he slipped it into the ribbon which bound the golden tresses of his youthful companion and what if i enwreathed my own <\s>
<s> twere no offence to reason the sober hills thus deck their brows to meet the wintry season <\s>
<s> k from recollections of the last days of shelley and byron <\s>
<s> some days after this conversation i walked to lausanne to breakfast at the hotel with an old friend captain daniel roberts of the navy <\s>
<s> he was out sketching but presently came in accompanied by two english ladies with whom he had made acquaintance whilst drawing and whom he brought to our hotel <\s>
<s> the husband of one of them soon followed <\s>
<s> i saw by their utilitarian garb as well as by the blisters and blotches on their cheeks lips and noses that they were pedestrian tourists fresh from the snow covered mountains the blazing sun and frosty air having acted on their unseasoned skins as boiling water does on the lobster by dyeing his dark coat scarlet <\s>
<s> the man was evidently a denizen of the north his accent harsh skin white of an angular and bony build and self confident and dogmatic in his opinions <\s>
<s> the precision and quaintness of his language as well as his eccentric remarks on common things stimulated my mind <\s>
<s> our icy islanders thaw rapidly when they have drifted into warmer latitudes broken loose from its anti social system mystic castes coteries sets and sects they lay aside their purse proud tuft hunting and toadying ways and are very apt to run risk in the enjoyment of all their senses <\s>
<s> besides we were compelled to talk in strange company if not from good breeding to prove our breed as the gift of speech is often our principal if not sole distinction from the rest of the brute animals <\s>
<s> to return to our breakfast <\s>
<s> the travellers flushed with health delighted with their excursion and with appetites earned by bodily and mental activity were in such high spirits that roberts and i caught the infection of their mouth we talked as loud and fast as if under the exhilarating influence of champagne instead of such a sedative compound as caf?? au lait <\s>
<s> i can rescue nothing out of oblivion but a few last words <\s>
<s> the stranger expressed his disgust at the introduction of carriages into the mountain districts of switzerland and at the old fogies who used them <\s>
<s> as to the arbitrary pitiless godless wretches he exclaimed who have removed nature's landmarks by cutting roads through alps and apennines until all things are reduced to the same dead level they will he arraigned hereafter with the unjust they have robbed the best specimens of what men should be of their freeholds in the mountains the eagle the black cock and the red deer they have tamed or exterminated <\s>
<s> the lover of nature can nowhere find a solitary nook to contemplate her beauties <\s>
<s> yesterday he continued at the break of day i scaled the most rugged height within my reach it looked inaccessible this pleasant delusion was quickly dispelled i was rudely startled out of a deep reverie by the accursed jarring jingling and rumbling of a calèche and harsh voices that drowned the torrent's fall <\s>
<s> the stranger now hearing a commotion in the street sprang on his feet looked out of the window and rang the bell violently <\s>
<s> waiter he said is that our carriage <\s>
<s> why did you not tells us <\s>
<s> come lasses be stirring the freshness of the day is gone <\s>
<s> you may rejoice in not having to walk there is a chance of saving the remnants of skin the sun has left on our chins and noses to day we shall he stewed instead of barbecued <\s>
<s> on their leaving the room to get ready for their journey my friend roberts told me the strangers were the poet wordsworth his wife and sister <\s>
<s> who could have divined this <\s>
<s> i could see no trace in the hard features and weather stained brow of the outer man of the divinity within him <\s>
<s> in a few minutes the travellers reappeared we cordially shook hands and agreed to meet again at geneva <\s>
<s> now that i knew that i was talking to one of the veterans of the gentle craft as there was no time to waste in idle ceremony i asked him abruptly what he thought of shelley as a poet <\s>
<s> nothing he replied as abruptly <\s>
<s> seeing my surprise he added a poet who has not produced a good poem before he is twenty five we may conclude cannot and never will do so <\s>
<s> won't do he replied shaking his head as he got into the carriage a rough coated scotch terrier followed him <\s>
<s> this hairy fellow is our flea trap he shouted out as they started off <\s>
<s> when i recovered from the shock of having heard the harsh sentence passed by an elder bard on a younger brother of the muses i exclaimed after all poets are but earth <\s>
<s> it is the old story envy cain and abel <\s>
<s> professions sects and communities in general right or wrong hold together men of the pen excepted if one of their guild is worsted in the battle they do as the rooks do by their inky brothers fly from him cawing and screaming if they don't fire the shot they sound the bugle to charge <\s>
<s> i did not then know that the full fledged author never reads the writings of his contemporaries except to cut them up in a review that being a work of love <\s>
<s> in after years shelley being dead wordsworth confessed this fact he was then induced to read some of shelley's poems and admitted that shelley was the greatest master of harmonious verse in our modern literature <\s>

<s> rydal where we now are has an air of repose and seclusion which i have rarely seen surpassed the first few days we were here we perfectly luxuriated in the purity and sweetness of the air and the delicious stillness of its pastures and woods <\s>
<s> it is interesting too on another account as being the residence of the poet wordsworth his house is about a quarter of a mile from ours and since osler joined us we have obtained an introduction to him and he favoured us with his company at tea one evening last week <\s>
<s> he is a very interesting man remarkably simple in his manners full of enthusiasm and eloquence in conversation especially on the subject of his favourite art poetry which he seems to have studied in a very philosophical spirit and about which he entertains some peculiar opinions <\s>
<s> spenser shakspeare and milton are his favourites among the english poets especially the latter whom he almost idolises <\s>
<s> he expressed one opinion which rather surprised me and in which i could not concur that he preferred the samson agonistes to comus <\s>
<s> he recited in vindication of his judgment one very fine passage from the former poem and in a very striking manner his voice is deep and pathetic and thrills with feeling <\s>
<s> he is toryish at least what would he considered so in his political principles though he disclaims all connection with party and certainly argues with great fairness and temper on controverted topics such as parliamentary reform and catholic emancipation <\s>
<s> we took a long walk with him the other evening to the scene of one of his pastorals in the neighbourhood of grasmere <\s>
<s> he has a good deal of general conversation and has more the manners of a man of the world than i should have expected from his poems but his discourse indicates great simplicity and purity of mind indeed nothing renders his conversation more interesting than the unaffected tone of elevated morality and devotion which pervades it <\s>
<s> we have been reading his long poem the excursion since we came here <\s>
<s> i particularly recommend it to your notice barring some few extra vagancies into which his peculiar theory has led him his fourth book the last contains specimens both of versification sentiment and imagery scarcely inferior to what you will find in the best passages of milton <\s>
<s> he spoke with great plainness and yet with candour of his contemporaries <\s>
