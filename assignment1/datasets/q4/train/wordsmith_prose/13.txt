<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>

<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>

<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>

<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>

<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>

<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>

<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>

<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>

<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>

<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>

<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>

<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>

<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>

<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>

<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>

<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>

<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>

<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>

<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>

<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>

<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>

<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>

<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>

<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>

<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>

<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>

<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>

<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>

<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>

<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>

<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>

<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>

<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>

<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>

<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>

<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>

<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>

<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>

<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>

<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>

<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>

<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>

<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>

<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>

<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>

<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>

<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>

<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>

<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>

<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>

<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>

<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>

<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>

<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>

<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>

<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>

<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>

<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>

<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>

<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>

<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>

<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>

<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>

<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>

<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>

<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>

<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>

<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>

<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>

<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>

<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>

<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>

<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>

<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>

<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>

<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>

<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>

<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>

<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>

<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>

<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>

<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>

<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>

<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>

<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>

<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>
<s> without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in war the citizens of saragossa began the contest <\s>
<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>

<s> enough of what was needful was produced and created and by courage fortitude and skill rapidly matured they baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments <\s>
<s> in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second <\s>
<s> for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of old a little more of such conquest and i am destroyed <\s>
<s> if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintained it has been furnished in overflowing measure <\s>
<s> a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating <\s>
<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>
<s> the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes <\s>
<s> though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service <\s>
<s> yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthood no nobility no large body of powerful burghers from passion interest and conscience opposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all <\s>
<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>
<s> as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success <\s>
<s> but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances <\s>
<s> disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable <\s>
<s> on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline <\s>
<s> large bodies of the british army have been several times broken that is technically vanquished in egypt and elsewhere <\s>
<s> yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men <\s>
<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>
<s> combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless <\s>
<s> before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away <\s>

<s> hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish <\s>
<s> and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage <\s>
<s> it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite object plunder and conquest <\s>
<s> it is i allow a frightful spectacle to see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization <\s>
<s> such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forth to determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided <\s>
<s> with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses <\s>
<s> and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f ); and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europe to fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes <\s>
<s> now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done <\s>
<s> but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediately the power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of molten brass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent <\s>
<s> great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock <\s>
<s> magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria <\s>
<s> we have now a vast military force and even without a peterborough or a marlborough at this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever <\s>
<s> the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely <\s>
<s> for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but liberty in which it originated and of which it is a depravation is far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil <\s>
<s> the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their height and all engaged in the furtherance of wrong <\s>
<s> but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be <\s>
<s> i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions <\s>
<s> besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression <\s>
<s> the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it <\s>
<s> if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turned not only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery <\s>
<s> occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature <\s>
<s> it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad cause men without magnanimity honour or justice could recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained <\s>

<s> this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in society by taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their command to which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire <\s>

<s> most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people <\s>
<s> the same city has also exemplified a melancholy yea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upon their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours ); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the market place before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellings blazing or up rooted <\s>
<s> the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment <\s>
<s> nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with <\s>
<s> in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain <\s>
<s> the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon <\s>
<s> beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and military perhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldiers troops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existed than those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew <\s>
<s> cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that is such of the people as had in the author's language the fanatic humour ); teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king <\s>
<s> and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolder and too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place <\s>
<s> and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwards finding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and merit the lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness <\s>
<s> and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he had came out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in <\s>
<s> so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men <\s>
<s> but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience <\s>
<s> apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain <\s>
<s> in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dread and to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunes add the devotion of that people to their religion as catholics and it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable <\s>
<s> there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggles which may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause <\s>
<s> the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the reader's perusal informs us that in every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerous was padre st <\s>
<s> iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza <\s>
<s> as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his country he was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commander in chief <\s>
<s> the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwick's memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality <\s>
<s> my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements <\s>
<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
<s> wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counter working and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings <\s>
<s> but i am speaking of good in a direct course <\s>
<s> all good in this order all moral good begins and ends in reverence of right <\s>
<s> the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creatures but as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things <\s>
<s> can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountain head and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth <\s>
<s> look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spain it might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees per me si va nella citt ?dolente per me si va nell eterno dolore per me si va tra la perduta gente <\s>
<s> so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the short sighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss <\s>
<s> i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fear for promoting the fulfilment of these duties which cannot fail <\s>
<s> the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages <\s>
<s> and it is consolatory to think that even if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz <\s>
<s> riddance of the enemy and security of national independence ); it is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government <\s>
<s> we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reason acting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them <\s>
<s> it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause <\s>
<s> but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne along at all events the road is plain <\s>
<s> let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible <\s>
<s> in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly <\s>
<s> let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge <\s>
<s> let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it <\s>
<s> with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution <\s>
<s> much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniards why should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders <\s>
<s> i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are well intentioned yet timid <\s>
<s> that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to risk all their privileges their honours and possessions by their resistance to the invader <\s>
<s> why then should they have fears from a quarter whence their safety must come if it come at all spain has nothing to dread from jacobinism <\s>
<s> manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhere by unnaturally clustering the people together enfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations <\s>
<s> madrid is no enormous city like paris over grown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic <\s>
<s> nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain <\s>
<s> no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground <\s>
<s> a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at hap hazard self persuaded that he is proceeding according to art <\s>

<s> the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings <\s>
<s> if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer that if there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fall nature will provide for that necessity <\s>
<s> the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements <\s>
<s> oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spain that the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatred of apprehensions and of wishes adequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit <\s>
<s> the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without <\s>
<s> but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things <\s>
<s> i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience <\s>
<s> now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathing spaces from generation to generation wars why and wherefore <\s>
<s> yet with courage with perseverance with self sacrifice with enthusiasm with cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factions vanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghost like hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the life distemper of ambition these inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horse race a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estate these demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of man in all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon them do immeasurably transcend their objects <\s>
<s> the true sorrow of humanity consists in this not that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused <\s>
