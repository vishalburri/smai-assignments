<s> hemans was unfortunate as a poetess in being obliged by circumstances to write for money and that so frequently and so much that she was compelled to look out for subjects wherever she could find them and to write as expeditiously as possible <\s>
<s> as a woman she was to a considerable degree a spoilt child of the world <\s>

<s> hemans not in the least suspecting my drift reported this saying in a letter to a friend at the time as a proof of my simplicity <\s>

<s> as it is i remember her with true affection for her amiable qualities and above all for her delicate and irreproachable conduct during her long separation from an unfeeling husband whom she had been led to marry from the romantic notions of inexperienced youth <\s>

<s> to the attentive and competent reader the whole sufficiently explains itself but there may be no harm in adverting here to particular feelings or experiences of my own mind on which the structure of the poem partly rests <\s>
<s> nothing was more difficult for me in childhood than to admit the notion of death as a state applicable to my own being <\s>

<s> 5 this most beautiful plant is scarce in england though it is found in great abundance upon the mountains of scotland <\s>
<s> the first specimen i ever saw of it in its native bed was singularly fine the tuft or cushion being at least eight inches in diameter and the root proportionably thick <\s>
<s> i have only met with it in two places among our mountains in both of which i have since sought for it in vain <\s>
<s> botanists will not i hope take it ill if i caution them against carrying off inconsiderately rare and beautiful plants <\s>
<s> this has often been done particularly from ingleborough and other mountains in yorkshire till the species have totally disappeared to the great regret of lovers of nature living near the places where they grew <\s>

<s> this lady had been a widow long before i knew her <\s>
<s> her husband was of the family of the lady celebrated in the rape of the lock and was i believe a roman catholic <\s>
<s> the sorrow which his death caused her was fearful in its character as described in this poem but was subdued in course of time by the strength of her religious faith <\s>
<s> i have been for many weeks at a time an inmate with her at coleorton hall as were also mary and my sister <\s>
<s> the truth in the sketch of her character here given was acknowledged with gratitude by her nearest relatives <\s>
<s> she was eloquent in conversation energetic upon public matters open in respect to these but slow to communicate her personal feelings <\s>
<s> upon these she never touched in her intercourse with me so that i could not regard myself as her confidential friend and was accordingly surprised when i learnt she had left me a legacy of 100l as a token of her esteem <\s>
<s> see in further illustration the second stanza inscribed upon her cenotaph in coleorton church <\s>
<s> elegiac musings in the grounds of coleorton hall xiii these verses were in fact composed on horseback during a storm whilst i was on my way from coleorton to cambridge <\s>
<s> they are alluded to elsewhere <\s>
<s> quillinan my father was on my pony which he rode all the way from rydal to cambridge that i might have the comfort and pleasure of a horse at cambridge <\s>
<s> the storm of wind and rain on this day was so violent that the coach in which my mother and i travelled the same coach was all but blown over and had the coachman drawn up as he attempted to do at one of his halting places we must have been upset <\s>
<s> my father and his pony were several times actually blown out of the road <\s>
<s> xiv from the most gentle creature nursed in fields <\s>
<s> this way of indicating the name of my lamented friend has been found fault with perhaps rightly so but i may say in justification of the double sense of the word that similar allusions are not uncommon in epitaphs <\s>
<s> one of the best in our language in verse i ever read was upon a person who bore the name of palmer and the course of the thought throughout turned upon the life of the departed considered as a pilgrimage <\s>
<s> nor can i think that the objection in the present case will have much force with any one who remembers charles lamb's beautiful sonnet addressed to his own name and ending no deed of mine shall shame thee gentle name <\s>

<s> serjeant talfourd shall be at liberty to relate particulars which could not at the time when his memoir was written be given to the public <\s>
<s> mary lamb was ten years older than her brother and has survived him as long a time <\s>
<s> were i to give way to my own feelings i should dwell not only on her genius and intellectual powers but upon the delicacy and refinement of manner which she maintained inviolable under most trying circumstances <\s>
<s> she was loved and honoured by all her brother's friends and others some of them strange characters whom his philanthropic peculiarities induced him to countenance <\s>
<s> the death of c <\s>
<s> lamb himself was doubtless hastened by his sorrow for that of coleridge to whom he had been attached from the time of their being schoolfellows at christ's hospital <\s>
<s> lamb was a good latin scholar and probably would have gone to college upon one of the school foundations but for the impediment in his speech <\s>
<s> had such been his lot he would have probably been preserved from the indulgences of social humours and fancies which were often injurious to himself and causes of severe regret to his friends without really benefiting the object of his misapplied kindness <\s>
