<s> he repeated his sonnet on the pennsylvanians and again that on young england which i admire so much <\s>
<s> march 6th wordsworth whom we met yesterday at dinner at the oaks expressed his dislike to monuments in churches partly from the absurdity and falsehood of the epitaphs which sometimes belonged to them and partly from their injuring the architectural beauties of the edifice as they grievously did in westminster abbey and many other cathedrals <\s>
<s> he made an exception in favour of those old knightly monuments which he admitted added to the solemnity of the scene and were in keeping with the buildings and he added i must also except another monument which once made a deep impression on my mind <\s>

<s> i went there to see his tomb but i did not expect to see himself and it impressed me deeply <\s>
<s> there he was a man whose fame extends over the whole civilised world sitting calmly age after age in white robes of pure alabaster in this small country church seldom visited except by some stray traveller he having desired to be interred in this spot to lie near his mother <\s>

<s> november 8th 1845 on our way to take an early dinner at foxhow yesterday we met the poet at the foot of his own hill and he engaged us to go to tea to the mount on our way home to hear their adventures he and his mary having just returned from a six weeks wander among their friends <\s>
<s> during their absence we always feel that the road between grasmere and ambleside is wanting in something beautiful as it is <\s>
<s> we reached the mount before six and found dear mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth much restored by her tour <\s>
<s> she has enjoyed the visit to her kith and kin in herefordshire extremely and we had a nice comfortable chat round the fire and the tea table <\s>
<s> after tea in speaking of the misfortune it was when a young man did not seem more inclined to one profession than another wordsworth said that he had always some feeling of indulgence for men at that age who felt such a difficulty <\s>
<s> he had himself passed through it and had incurred the strictures of his friends and relations on this subject <\s>
<s> he said that after he had finished his college course he was in great doubt as to what his future employment should be <\s>
<s> he did not feel himself good enough for the church he felt that his mind was not properly disciplined for that holy office and that the struggle between his conscience and his impulses would have made life a torture <\s>
<s> he also shrank from the law although southey often told him that he was well fitted for the higher parts of the profession <\s>
<s> he had studied military history with great interest and the strategy of war and he always fancied that he had talents for command and he at one time thought of a military life but then he was without connections and he felt if he were ordered to the west indies his talents would not save him from the yellow fever and he gave that up <\s>
<s> at this time he had only a hundred a year <\s>
<s> upon this he lived and travelled and married for it was not until the late lord lonsdale came into possession that the money which was due to them was restored <\s>
<s> he mentioned this to show how difficult it often was to judge of what was passing in a young man's mind but he thought that for the generality of men it was much better that they should be early led to the exercise of a profession of their own choice <\s>
<s> december 1846 henry fletcher and i dined at the mount on the 21st of this month <\s>
<s> the party consisted of mr <\s>
<s> crabb robinson their christmas guest mrs <\s>
<s> arnold miss martineau and ourselves <\s>
<s> my mother's cold was too bad to allow her to go which i regretted as it was like all their little meetings most sociable and agreeable <\s>
<s> wordsworth was much pleased with a little notice of his new edition in the examiner he thought it very well done <\s>
<s> he expressed himself very sweetly at dinner on the pleasant terms of neighbourly kindness we enjoyed in the valleys <\s>
<s> it will be pleasant in after times to remember his words and still more his manner when he said this it was done with such perfect simplicity and equality of feeling without the slightest reference to self and i am sure without thinking of himself at the time as more than one of the little circle whose friendly feeling he was commending <\s>
<s> october 1846 wordsworth dined with us one day last week and was in much greater vigour than i have seen him all this summer <\s>
<s> he mentioned incidentally that the spelling of our language was very much fixed in the time of charles the second and that the attempts which had been made since and are being made in the present day were not likely to succeed <\s>
<s> he entered his protest as usual against carlyle's style and said that since johnson no writer had done so much to vitiate the english language <\s>
<s> the opening towards the sea as we went on was very pleasing but the first striking view of the duddon was looking down upon it soon after we passed broughton where you turn to the right and very soon after perceive the peculiar beauty of the valley although it does not take its wild and dreamlike beauty till you pass ulpha kirk <\s>
<s> we reversed the order of the sonnets and saw the river first in radiant progress tow'rd the deep instead of tracing this child of the clouds from its cradle in the lofty waste <\s>
<s> we reached the kirk of ulpha between five and six <\s>
<s> the appearance of the little farm house inn at once made anything approaching to a dinner an impossibility had we wished it ever so much but in due time we had tea and boiled ham with two eggs apiece and were much invigorated by this our first duddonian meal <\s>
<s> the hostess was evidently surprised that we thought of remaining all night so humbly did she think of the accommodation she had to offer <\s>
<s> wordsworth sleeping there fifteen years ago because it was just after the birth of her daughter a nice comely girl who attended us at tea <\s>
<s> quillinan showed great good nature and unselfishness in the arrangements he made and the care he took of the admirable horse which i saw him feeding out of a tub a manger being too great a refinement for ulpha <\s>
<s> after tea although it was getting dark we went to the churchyard which commands a beautiful view towards seathwaite and we then walked in that direction through a lane where the walls were more richly covered by moss and fern than any i ever saw before <\s>
<s> a beautiful dark coloured tributary to the duddon comes down from the moors on the left hand about a mile from ulpha and soon after we had passed the small bridge over this stream mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth recollected a well which he had discovered some thirty or forty years before <\s>
<s> we went off the road in search of it through a shadowy embowered path and as it was almost dark we should probably have failed in finding it had we not met a very tiny boy with a can of water in his hand who looked at us in speechless amazement when the poet said is there a well here my little lad <\s>
<s> we found the well and then joined the road again by another path leaving the child to ponder whether we were creatures of earth or air <\s>
<s> saturday morning was cloudy but soft and lovely in its hazy effects <\s>
<s> when i went out about seven i saw wordsworth going a few steps and then moving on and stopping again in a very abstracted manner so i kept back <\s>
<s> but when he saw me he advanced and took me again to the churchyard to see the morning effects which were very lovely <\s>
<s> he said he had not slept well that the recollection of former days and people had crowded upon him and most of all my dear sister and when i thought of her state and of those who had passed away coleridge and southey and many others while i am left with all my many infirmities if not sins in full consciousness how could i sleep <\s>
<s> and then i took to the alteration of sonnets and that made the matter worse still <\s>
<s> then suddenly stopping before a little bunch of harebell which along with some parsley fern grew out of the wall near us he exclaimed how perfectly beautiful that is <\s>
<s> would that the little flowers that grow could live conscious of half the pleasure that they give he then expatiated on the inexhaustible beauty of the arrangements of nature its power of combining in the most secret recesses and that it must be for some purpose of beneficence that such operations existed <\s>
<s> after breakfast we got into the cart of the inn which had a seat swung into it upon which a bolster was put in honour i presume of the poet laureate <\s>
<s> in this we jogged on to seathwaite getting out to ascend a craggy eminence on the right which mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth admired the view from it is very striking <\s>
