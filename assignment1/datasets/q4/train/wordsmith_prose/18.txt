<s> on the occasion of these two addresses and other related matters see preface in the present volume <\s>
<s> two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> kendal printed by airey and bellingham <\s>
<s> the author thinks it proper to advise his reader that he alone is responsible for the sentiments and opinions expressed in these sheets <\s>
<s> gladly would he have availed himself of the judgment of others if that benefit could have been had without subjecting the persons consulted to the possibility of blame for having sanctioned any view of the topics under consideration which either from its erroneousness might deserve or from party feelings or other causes might incur censure <\s>
<s> the matter comprised in these pages was intended to compose a succession of addresses to be printed in the kendal chronicle and a part of the first was published through that channel <\s>
<s> the intention was dropped for reasons well known <\s>
<s> it is now mentioned in order to account for the disproportion in the length of the two addresses and an arrangement of matter in some places different from what would otherwise have been chosen <\s>
<s> a portion also has appeared in the carlisle patriot <\s>
<s> it is of little importance to add that this publication has been delayed by unavoidable engagements of the printer <\s>
<s> the new candidate has appeared amongst us and concluded for the present his labours in the county <\s>
<s> they require no further notice here than an expression of thanks for the success with which he has co operated with the author of these pages to demonstrate by the whole of his itinerant proceedings that the vital principle of the opposition ostensibly headed by him is at enmity with the bonds by which society is held together and government maintained <\s>
<s> to the freeholders c <\s>
<s> gentlemen two months have elapsed since warning was given of an intention to oppose the present representatives of the county of westmoreland at the ensuing election yet till so late a period as the 26th of january no avowal of such intention appeared from any quarter entitling it to consideration <\s>
<s> for as to the body of men calling itself the london committee there is not up to this hour i believe any public evidence even of its existence except certain notices signed by two obscure individuals <\s>
<s> but in the minds of those naturally interested in the welfare of the county a ferment was excited by various devices inflammatory addresses were busily circulated men laying claim to the flattering character of reformers of abuses became active and as this stir did not die away they who foresaw its bearings and tendencies were desirous that if there were any just grounds for discontent the same should be openly declared by persons whose characters and situations in life would be a pledge for their having proceeded upon mature deliberation <\s>
<s> at length a set of resolutions have appeared from a meeting of dissatisfied freeholders holden in a town which if not the principal in point of rank is the most populous opulent and weighty in the county <\s>
<s> among those who composed this meeting the first visible authentic body which the opposition has produced are to be found persons answering to the description above given men from whom might have been expected in the exposition of their complaints sound sense as to the nature of the grievances and rational views as to the mode of removing them have such expectations if entertained been fulfilled <\s>
<s> the first resolution unanimously agreed upon by this meeting is couched in these words it is impossible for us as freeholders to submit any longer to a single family however respectable naming both members for the county <\s>
<s> what if this leading article had been thus expressed <\s>
<s> that it is injurious to the interests and derogatory to the dignity of the county of westmoreland that both its representatives should be brought into parliament by the influence of one family <\s>
<s> words to this effect would surely have given the sense of the resolution as proceeding from men of cool reflection and offered nakedly to the consideration of minds which it was desired should be kept in a similar state <\s>
<s> but we cannot submit any longer' if the intention was to mislead and irritate such language was well adapted for the purpose but it ill accords with the spirit of the next resolution which affirms that the meeting is wholly unconnected with any political party and thus disclaiming indirectly those passions and prejudices that are apt to fasten upon political partisans implicitly promises that the opinions of the meeting shall be conveyed in terms suitable to such disavowal <\s>
<s> did the persons in question imagine themselves in a state of degradation <\s>
<s> on their own word we must believe they did and no one could object to their employing among each other such language as gave vent to feelings proceeding from that impression in a way that gratified themselves <\s>
<s> but by publishing their resolutions they shew that they are not communing for the sake of mutual sympathy but to induce others to participate a sentiment which probably they are strangers to <\s>
<s> we submit to the law and to those who are placed in authority over us while in the legitimate exercise of their functions we submit to the decrees of providence because they are not to be resisted a coward submits to be insulted a pusillanimous wretch to be despised and a knave if detected must submit to be scouted a slave submits to his taskmaster but the freeholders of westmoreland cannot in reason be said to submit to the house of lowther naming their representatives unless it can be proved that those representatives have been thrust upon them by an unjustifiable agency and that they owe their seats not to the free suffrages and frank consent of their constituents but to unfair means whether in the shape of seduction or threat <\s>
<s> if there be an indignity on one side there must have been a wrong done on the other and to make out this point it ought to have been shewn that some other person qualified by his property his education his rank and character had stood forth and offered himself to represent you freeholders of westmoreland in parliament and that in this attempt he had been crushed by the power of a single family careless of the mode in which that power was exercised <\s>
<s> i appeal to those who have had an opportunity of being acquainted with the noble lord who is at the head of that family whether they are of opinion that any consideration of his own interest or importance in the state would have induced him to oppose such a candidate provided there was reason for believing that the unabused sense of the county was with him <\s>
<s> if indeed a candidate supposed to be so favoured by the county had declared himself an enemy to the general measures of administration for some years past those measures have depended on principles of conduct of such vast importance that the noble lord must needs have endeavoured as far as prudence authorised to frustrate an attempt which in conscience he could not approve <\s>
<s> i affirm then that as there was no wrong there is no indignity the present members owe their high situation to circumstances local and national <\s>
<s> they are there because no one else has presented himself or for some years back has been likely to present himself with pretensions the reasonableness of which could enter into competition with their's <\s>
<s> this is in some points of view a misfortune but it is the fact and no class of men regret it more than the independent and judicious adherents of the house of lowther men who are happy and proud to rally round the nobleman who is the head of that house in defence of rational liberty men who know that he has proved himself a faithful guardian to the several orders of the state that he is a tried enemy to dangerous innovations a condemner of fantastic theories one who understands mankind and knows the heights and levels of human nature by which the course of the streams of social action is determined a lover of the people but one who despises as far as relates to his own practice and deplores in respect to that of others the shows and pretences and all the false arts by which the plaudits of the multitude are won and the people flattered to the common ruin of themselves and their deceivers <\s>
<s> but after all let us soberly enquire to what extent it is really an evil that two persons so nearly connected in blood should represent this county <\s>
<s> and first looking at the matter locally what is that portion of england known by the name of the county of westmoreland <\s>
<s> a county which indeed the natives of it love and are justly proud of a region famous for the production of shrewd intelligent brave active honest enterprising men but it covers no very large space on the map the soil is in general barren the country poor accordingly and of necessity thinly inhabited <\s>
<s> there are in england single towns even of a third or fourth rate importance that contain a larger population than is included within the limits of westmoreland from the foot of wrynose to the sides of stainmoor and from the banks of the kent to those of the emont <\s>
<s> is it then to be wondered at considering the antiquity of the house of lowther that circumstances should have raised it to the elevation which it holds in a district so thinly peopled neither rich in the products of agriculture nor in the materials of commerce and where it is impossible that any considerable number of country gentlemen of large or as our ancestors expressed themselves of notable estate can co exist <\s>
<s> it must unavoidably happen therefore that at all times there will be few persons in such a county furnished with the stable requisites of property rank family and personal fitness that shall point them out for such an office and dispose them to covet it by insuring that degree of public confidence which will make them independent comfortable and happy in discharging the duties which it imposes <\s>
<s> this small number will at particular periods be liable to be reduced that this has been the case is apparent upon retrospect and that the number is not large at present may be inferred from the difficulty with which a third candidate has been found and from the insignificant station which the individual who has at length obeyed the call of the discontented holds in the county <\s>
<s> with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully co operated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots <\s>
<s> looking up to the government with respectful attachment we all acknowledge that power must be controlled and checked or it will be abused hence the desirableness of a vigorous opposition in the house of commons and hence a wish grounded upon a conviction of general expediency that the opposition to ministry whose head and chief seat of action are in parliament should be efficaciously diffused through all parts of the country <\s>
<s> on this principle the two grand divisions of party under our free government are founded <\s>
<s> conscience regulated by expediency is the basis honour binding men to each other in spite of temptation is the corner stone and the superstructure is friendship protecting kindness gratitude and all the moral sentiments by which self interest is liberalized <\s>
<s> such is party looked at on the favourable side <\s>
<s> cogent moral inducements therefore exist for the prevalence of two powerful bodies in the practice of the state spreading their influence and interests throughout the country and on political considerations it is desirable that the strength of each should bear such proportion to that of the other that while ministry are able to carry into effect measures not palpably injurious the vigilance of opposition may turn to account being backed by power at all times sufficient to awe but never were that possible except when supported by manifest reason to intimidate <\s>
<s> such apportioning of the strength of the two parties has existed such a degree of power the opposition formerly possessed and if they have lost that salutary power if they are dwindled and divided they must ascribe it to their own errors <\s>
<s> they are weak because they have been unwise they are brought low because when they had solid and high ground to stand upon they took a flight into the air <\s>
<s> to have hoped too ardently of human nature as they did at the commencement of the french revolution was no dishonour to them as men but politicians cannot be allowed to plead temptations of fancy or impulses of feeling in exculpation of mistakes in judgement <\s>
<s> grant however to the enthusiasm of philanthropy as much indulgence as it may call for it is still extraordinary that in the minds of english statesmen and legislators the naked absurdity of the means did not raise a doubt as to the attainableness of the end <\s>
<s> fox captivated by the vanities of a system founded upon abstract rights chaunted his expectations in the house of parliament and too many of his friends partook of the illusion <\s>
<s> the most sagacious politician of his age broke out in an opposite strain <\s>
<s> time has verified his predictions the books remain in which his principles of foreknowledge were laid down but as the author became afterwards a pensioner of state thousands in this country of free opinions persist in asserting that his divination was guess work and that conscience had no part in urging him to speak <\s>
<s> that warning voice proved vain the party from whom he separated proceeded confiding in splendid oratorical talents and ardent feelings rashly wedded to novel expectations when common sense uninquisitive experience and a modest reliance on old habits of judgement when either these or a philosophic penetration were the only qualities that could have served them <\s>
<s> how many private individuals at that period were kept in a rational course by circumstances supplying restraints which their own understandings would not have furnished <\s>
<s> through what fatality it happens that bodies of men are so slow to profit in a similar way by circumstances affecting their prosperity the opposition seem never to have enquired <\s>
<s> they could not avoid observing that the holders of property throughout the country being mostly panic stricken by the proceedings in france turned instinctively against the admirers of the new system and as security for property is the very basis of civil society how was it possible but that reflecting men who perceived this truth should mistrust those representatives of the people who could not have acted less prudently had they been utterly unconscious of it <\s>
<s> but they had committed themselves and did not retract either from unabating devotion to their cause or from false honour and that self injuring consistency the favourite sister of obstinacy which the mixed conscience of mankind is but too apt to produce <\s>
<s> meanwhile the tactics of parliament must continue in exercise on some system or other their adversaries were to be annoyed at any rate and so intent were they upon this that in proportion as the entrenchments of ministry strengthened the assaults of opposition became more careless and desperate <\s>
<s> while the war of words and opinions was going forward in this country europe was deluged with blood <\s>
<s> they in whose hands power was vested among us in course of time lost ground in public opinion through the failure of their efforts <\s>
<s> parties were broken and re composed but men who are brought together less by principle than by events cannot cordially co operate or remain long united <\s>
<s> the opponents of the war in this middle stage and desponding state of it were not popular and afterwards when the success of the enemy made the majority of the nation feel that peace dictated by him could not be lasting and they were bent on persevering in the struggle the party of opposition persisted in a course of action which as their countenance of the doctrine of the rights of man had brought their understandings into disrepute cast suspicion on the soundness of their patriotic affections <\s>
<s> their passions made them blind to the differences between a state of peace and war above all such a war as prescribing rules for their own conduct <\s>
<s> they were ignorant or never bore in mind that a species of hostility which had there been no foreign enemy to resist might have proved useful and honourable became equally pernicious and disgraceful when a formidable foe threatened us with destruction <\s>
<s> i appeal to impartial recollection whether during the course of the late awful struggle and in the latter stages of it especially the antagonists of ministers in the two houses of parliament did not for the most part conduct themselves more like allies to a military despot who was attempting to enslave the world and to whom their own country was an object of paramount hatred than like honest englishmen who had breathed the air of liberty from their cradles <\s>
<s> if any state of things could supply them with motives for acting in that manner they must abide by the consequences <\s>
<s> they must reconcile themselves as well as they can to dislike and to disesteem the unavoidable results of behaviour so unnatural <\s>
<s> peace has indeed come but do they who deprecated the continuance of the war and clamoured for its close on any terms rejoice heartily in a triumph by which their prophecies were belied <\s>
<s> did they lend their voices to swell the hymn of transport that resounded through our land when the arch enemy was overthrown <\s>
<s> are they pleased that inheritances have been restored and that legitimate governments have been re established on the continent <\s>
<s> and do they grieve when those re established governments act unworthily of the favour which providence has shown them <\s>
<s> do not too many rather secretly congratulate themselves on every proof of imbecility or misconduct there exhibited and endeavour that attention shall be exclusively fixed on those melancholy facts as if they were the only fruits of a triumph to which we britons owe that we are a fearless undishonoured and rapidly improving people and the nations of the continent owe their very existence as self governed communities <\s>
<s> the party of opposition or what remains of it has much to repent of many humiliating reflections must pass through the minds of those who compose it and they must learn the hard lesson to be thankful for them as a discipline indispensible to their amendment <\s>
<s> thus only can they furnish a sufficient nucleus for the formation of a new body nor can there be any hope of such body being adequate to its appropriate service and of its possessing that portion of good opinion which shall entitle it to the respect of its antagonists unless it live and act for a length of time under a distinct conception of the kind and degree of hostility to the executive government which is fairly warrantable <\s>
<s> the party must cease indiscriminately to court the discontented and to league itself with men who are athirst for innovation to a point which leaves it doubtful whether an opposition that is willing to co operate with such agitators loves as it ought to do and becomingly venerates the happy and glorious constitution in church and state which we have inherited from our ancestors <\s>
<s> till not a doubt can be left that this indispensible change has been effected freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> you will remain but to exhort is not my present business i was retracing the history of the influence of one family and have shewn that much of it depends upon that steady support given by them to government during a long and arduous struggle and upon the general course of their public conduct which has secured your approbation and won for them your confidence <\s>
<s> let us now candidly ask what practical evil has arisen from this preponderance <\s>
<s> is it not obvious that it is justified by the causes that have produced it <\s>
<s> as far as it concerns the general well being of the kingdom it would be easy to shew that if the democratic activities of the great towns and of the manufacturing districts were not counteracted by the sedentary power of large estates continued from generation to generation in particular families it would be scarcely possible that the laws and constitution of the country could sustain the shocks which they would be subject to <\s>
<s> and as to our own county that man must be strangely prejudiced who does not perceive how desireable it is that some powerful individual should he attached to it who by his influence with government may facilitate the execution of any plan tending with due concern for general welfare to the especial benefit of westmoreland <\s>
<s> the influence of the house of lowther is we acknowledge great but has a case been made out that this influence has been abused <\s>
<s> the voice of gratitude is not loud out of delicacy to the benefactor but if all who know were at liberty to speak to the measure of their wishes the services which have been rendered by the house of lowther to westmoreland its natives and inhabitants would be proclaimed in a manner that would confound detraction yet the kendal committee of the 26th of january without troubling themselves to inquire how far this preponderance is a reasonable thing and what have been its real and practical effects are indignant their blood is roused and they are determined to address their brother freeholders and call upon them to recover the exercise of the elective franchise which has been withheld from them for half a century withheld from them <\s>
<s> suppose these champions in this their first declaration of hostility had said to recover the elective franchise which we have suffered to lie dormant <\s>
<s> but no who would take blame to himself when by so doing he is likely to break the force of the indignation which whether deserved or not he hopes to heap upon his adversary <\s>
<s> this is politic but does it become professing men <\s>
<s> does it suit those who set forward with a proclamation that they are select spirits free from party ties and of course superior to those artifices and misrepresentations to those groundless or immoderate aversions which men who act in parties find it so difficult to keep clear of <\s>
<s> what degree of discernment and consistency an assembly of persons who begin their labours with such professions and publish such intentions have shewn by making choice of the individual whom they have recommended as eminently entitled to their confidence and qualified to assist them in attaining their end may become the fit subject of a future enquiry <\s>
<s> so these states have been called <\s>
<s> they are weaknesses a true though ill sounding title and not powers <\s>
<s> polybius tells us that hannibal entered into italy with twenty thousand men and that the aggregate forces of italy at that time amounted to seven hundred and sixty thousand foot and horse with the roman discipline and power to head that mighty force <\s>
<s> gustavus adolphus invaded germany with thirteen thousand men the emperor at that time having between two and three hundred thousand warlike and experienced troops commanded by able generals to oppose to him <\s>
<s> let these facts and numerous others which history supplies of the same kind be thought of and let us hear no more of the impossibility of great britain girt round and defended by the sea and an invincible navy becoming a military power great britain whose troops surpass in valour those of all the world and who has an army and a militia of upwards of three hundred thousand men <\s>
<s> do reflect my dear sir upon the materials which are now in preparation upon the continent <\s>
<s> hannibal expected to be joined by a parcel of the contented barbarian gauls in the north of italy <\s>
<s> gustavus stood forth as the champion of the protestant interest how feeble and limited each of these auxiliary sentiments and powers compared with what the state of knowledge the oppressions of their domestic governments and the insults and injuries and hostile cruelties inflicted by the french upon the continental nations must have exerted to second our arms whenever we shall appear in that force which we can assume and with that boldness which would become us and which justice and human nature and patriotism call upon us to put forth <\s>

<s> with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully co operated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots <\s>

<s> they could not avoid observing that the holders of property throughout the country being mostly panic stricken by the proceedings in france turned instinctively against the admirers of the new system and as security for property is the very basis of civil society how was it possible but that reflecting men who perceived this truth should mistrust those representatives of the people who could not have acted less prudently had they been utterly unconscious of it <\s>
<s> but they had committed themselves and did not retract either from unabating devotion to their cause or from false honour and that self injuring consistency the favourite sister of obstinacy which the mixed conscience of mankind is but too apt to produce <\s>
<s> meanwhile the tactics of parliament must continue in exercise on some system or other their adversaries were to be annoyed at any rate and so intent were they upon this that in proportion as the entrenchments of ministry strengthened the assaults of opposition became more careless and desperate <\s>
<s> while the war of words and opinions was going forward in this country europe was deluged with blood <\s>
<s> they in whose hands power was vested among us in course of time lost ground in public opinion through the failure of their efforts <\s>
<s> parties were broken and re composed but men who are brought together less by principle than by events cannot cordially co operate or remain long united <\s>
<s> the opponents of the war in this middle stage and desponding state of it were not popular and afterwards when the success of the enemy made the majority of the nation feel that peace dictated by him could not be lasting and they were bent on persevering in the struggle the party of opposition persisted in a course of action which as their countenance of the doctrine of the rights of man had brought their understandings into disrepute cast suspicion on the soundness of their patriotic affections <\s>
<s> their passions made them blind to the differences between a state of peace and war above all such a war as prescribing rules for their own conduct <\s>
<s> they were ignorant or never bore in mind that a species of hostility which had there been no foreign enemy to resist might have proved useful and honourable became equally pernicious and disgraceful when a formidable foe threatened us with destruction <\s>
<s> i appeal to impartial recollection whether during the course of the late awful struggle and in the latter stages of it especially the antagonists of ministers in the two houses of parliament did not for the most part conduct themselves more like allies to a military despot who was attempting to enslave the world and to whom their own country was an object of paramount hatred than like honest englishmen who had breathed the air of liberty from their cradles <\s>
<s> if any state of things could supply them with motives for acting in that manner they must abide by the consequences <\s>
<s> they must reconcile themselves as well as they can to dislike and to disesteem the unavoidable results of behaviour so unnatural <\s>
<s> peace has indeed come but do they who deprecated the continuance of the war and clamoured for its close on any terms rejoice heartily in a triumph by which their prophecies were belied <\s>
<s> did they lend their voices to swell the hymn of transport that resounded through our land when the arch enemy was overthrown <\s>
<s> are they pleased that inheritances have been restored and that legitimate governments have been re established on the continent <\s>
<s> and do they grieve when those re established governments act unworthily of the favour which providence has shown them <\s>
<s> do not too many rather secretly congratulate themselves on every proof of imbecility or misconduct there exhibited and endeavour that attention shall be exclusively fixed on those melancholy facts as if they were the only fruits of a triumph to which we britons owe that we are a fearless undishonoured and rapidly improving people and the nations of the continent owe their very existence as self governed communities <\s>
<s> the party of opposition or what remains of it has much to repent of many humiliating reflections must pass through the minds of those who compose it and they must learn the hard lesson to be thankful for them as a discipline indispensible to their amendment <\s>
<s> thus only can they furnish a sufficient nucleus for the formation of a new body nor can there be any hope of such body being adequate to its appropriate service and of its possessing that portion of good opinion which shall entitle it to the respect of its antagonists unless it live and act for a length of time under a distinct conception of the kind and degree of hostility to the executive government which is fairly warrantable <\s>
<s> the party must cease indiscriminately to court the discontented and to league itself with men who are athirst for innovation to a point which leaves it doubtful whether an opposition that is willing to co operate with such agitators loves as it ought to do and becomingly venerates the happy and glorious constitution in church and state which we have inherited from our ancestors <\s>
<s> till not a doubt can be left that this indispensible change has been effected freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> you will remain but to exhort is not my present business i was retracing the history of the influence of one family and have shewn that much of it depends upon that steady support given by them to government during a long and arduous struggle and upon the general course of their public conduct which has secured your approbation and won for them your confidence <\s>
<s> let us now candidly ask what practical evil has arisen from this preponderance <\s>
<s> is it not obvious that it is justified by the causes that have produced it <\s>
<s> as far as it concerns the general well being of the kingdom it would be easy to shew that if the democratic activities of the great towns and of the manufacturing districts were not counteracted by the sedentary power of large estates continued from generation to generation in particular families it would be scarcely possible that the laws and constitution of the country could sustain the shocks which they would be subject to <\s>
<s> and as to our own county that man must be strangely prejudiced who does not perceive how desireable it is that some powerful individual should he attached to it who by his influence with government may facilitate the execution of any plan tending with due concern for general welfare to the especial benefit of westmoreland <\s>
<s> the influence of the house of lowther is we acknowledge great but has a case been made out that this influence has been abused <\s>
<s> the voice of gratitude is not loud out of delicacy to the benefactor but if all who know were at liberty to speak to the measure of their wishes the services which have been rendered by the house of lowther to westmoreland its natives and inhabitants would be proclaimed in a manner that would confound detraction yet the kendal committee of the 26th of january without troubling themselves to inquire how far this preponderance is a reasonable thing and what have been its real and practical effects are indignant their blood is roused and they are determined to address their brother freeholders and call upon them to recover the exercise of the elective franchise which has been withheld from them for half a century withheld from them <\s>
<s> suppose these champions in this their first declaration of hostility had said to recover the elective franchise which we have suffered to lie dormant <\s>
<s> but no who would take blame to himself when by so doing he is likely to break the force of the indignation which whether deserved or not he hopes to heap upon his adversary <\s>
<s> this is politic but does it become professing men <\s>
<s> does it suit those who set forward with a proclamation that they are select spirits free from party ties and of course superior to those artifices and misrepresentations to those groundless or immoderate aversions which men who act in parties find it so difficult to keep clear of <\s>
<s> what degree of discernment and consistency an assembly of persons who begin their labours with such professions and publish such intentions have shewn by making choice of the individual whom they have recommended as eminently entitled to their confidence and qualified to assist them in attaining their end may become the fit subject of a future enquiry <\s>
<s> so these states have been called <\s>
<s> they are weaknesses a true though ill sounding title and not powers <\s>
<s> polybius tells us that hannibal entered into italy with twenty thousand men and that the aggregate forces of italy at that time amounted to seven hundred and sixty thousand foot and horse with the roman discipline and power to head that mighty force <\s>
<s> gustavus adolphus invaded germany with thirteen thousand men the emperor at that time having between two and three hundred thousand warlike and experienced troops commanded by able generals to oppose to him <\s>
<s> let these facts and numerous others which history supplies of the same kind be thought of and let us hear no more of the impossibility of great britain girt round and defended by the sea and an invincible navy becoming a military power great britain whose troops surpass in valour those of all the world and who has an army and a militia of upwards of three hundred thousand men <\s>
<s> do reflect my dear sir upon the materials which are now in preparation upon the continent <\s>
<s> hannibal expected to be joined by a parcel of the contented barbarian gauls in the north of italy <\s>
<s> gustavus stood forth as the champion of the protestant interest how feeble and limited each of these auxiliary sentiments and powers compared with what the state of knowledge the oppressions of their domestic governments and the insults and injuries and hostile cruelties inflicted by the french upon the continental nations must have exerted to second our arms whenever we shall appear in that force which we can assume and with that boldness which would become us and which justice and human nature and patriotism call upon us to put forth <\s>

<s> two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> on the occasion of these two addresses and other related matters see preface in the present volume <\s>
<s> two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> kendal printed by airey and bellingham <\s>
<s> the author thinks it proper to advise his reader that he alone is responsible for the sentiments and opinions expressed in these sheets <\s>
<s> gladly would he have availed himself of the judgment of others if that benefit could have been had without subjecting the persons consulted to the possibility of blame for having sanctioned any view of the topics under consideration which either from its erroneousness might deserve or from party feelings or other causes might incur censure <\s>
<s> the matter comprised in these pages was intended to compose a succession of addresses to be printed in the kendal chronicle and a part of the first was published through that channel <\s>
<s> the intention was dropped for reasons well known <\s>
<s> it is now mentioned in order to account for the disproportion in the length of the two addresses and an arrangement of matter in some places different from what would otherwise have been chosen <\s>
<s> a portion also has appeared in the carlisle patriot <\s>
<s> it is of little importance to add that this publication has been delayed by unavoidable engagements of the printer <\s>
<s> the new candidate has appeared amongst us and concluded for the present his labours in the county <\s>
<s> they require no further notice here than an expression of thanks for the success with which he has co operated with the author of these pages to demonstrate by the whole of his itinerant proceedings that the vital principle of the opposition ostensibly headed by him is at enmity with the bonds by which society is held together and government maintained <\s>
<s> to the freeholders c <\s>
<s> gentlemen two months have elapsed since warning was given of an intention to oppose the present representatives of the county of westmoreland at the ensuing election yet till so late a period as the 26th of january no avowal of such intention appeared from any quarter entitling it to consideration <\s>
<s> for as to the body of men calling itself the london committee there is not up to this hour i believe any public evidence even of its existence except certain notices signed by two obscure individuals <\s>
<s> but in the minds of those naturally interested in the welfare of the county a ferment was excited by various devices inflammatory addresses were busily circulated men laying claim to the flattering character of reformers of abuses became active and as this stir did not die away they who foresaw its bearings and tendencies were desirous that if there were any just grounds for discontent the same should be openly declared by persons whose characters and situations in life would be a pledge for their having proceeded upon mature deliberation <\s>
<s> at length a set of resolutions have appeared from a meeting of dissatisfied freeholders holden in a town which if not the principal in point of rank is the most populous opulent and weighty in the county <\s>
<s> among those who composed this meeting the first visible authentic body which the opposition has produced are to be found persons answering to the description above given men from whom might have been expected in the exposition of their complaints sound sense as to the nature of the grievances and rational views as to the mode of removing them have such expectations if entertained been fulfilled <\s>
<s> the first resolution unanimously agreed upon by this meeting is couched in these words it is impossible for us as freeholders to submit any longer to a single family however respectable naming both members for the county <\s>
<s> what if this leading article had been thus expressed <\s>
<s> that it is injurious to the interests and derogatory to the dignity of the county of westmoreland that both its representatives should be brought into parliament by the influence of one family <\s>
<s> words to this effect would surely have given the sense of the resolution as proceeding from men of cool reflection and offered nakedly to the consideration of minds which it was desired should be kept in a similar state <\s>
<s> but we cannot submit any longer' if the intention was to mislead and irritate such language was well adapted for the purpose but it ill accords with the spirit of the next resolution which affirms that the meeting is wholly unconnected with any political party and thus disclaiming indirectly those passions and prejudices that are apt to fasten upon political partisans implicitly promises that the opinions of the meeting shall be conveyed in terms suitable to such disavowal <\s>
<s> did the persons in question imagine themselves in a state of degradation <\s>
<s> on their own word we must believe they did and no one could object to their employing among each other such language as gave vent to feelings proceeding from that impression in a way that gratified themselves <\s>
<s> but by publishing their resolutions they shew that they are not communing for the sake of mutual sympathy but to induce others to participate a sentiment which probably they are strangers to <\s>
<s> we submit to the law and to those who are placed in authority over us while in the legitimate exercise of their functions we submit to the decrees of providence because they are not to be resisted a coward submits to be insulted a pusillanimous wretch to be despised and a knave if detected must submit to be scouted a slave submits to his taskmaster but the freeholders of westmoreland cannot in reason be said to submit to the house of lowther naming their representatives unless it can be proved that those representatives have been thrust upon them by an unjustifiable agency and that they owe their seats not to the free suffrages and frank consent of their constituents but to unfair means whether in the shape of seduction or threat <\s>
<s> if there be an indignity on one side there must have been a wrong done on the other and to make out this point it ought to have been shewn that some other person qualified by his property his education his rank and character had stood forth and offered himself to represent you freeholders of westmoreland in parliament and that in this attempt he had been crushed by the power of a single family careless of the mode in which that power was exercised <\s>
<s> i appeal to those who have had an opportunity of being acquainted with the noble lord who is at the head of that family whether they are of opinion that any consideration of his own interest or importance in the state would have induced him to oppose such a candidate provided there was reason for believing that the unabused sense of the county was with him <\s>
<s> if indeed a candidate supposed to be so favoured by the county had declared himself an enemy to the general measures of administration for some years past those measures have depended on principles of conduct of such vast importance that the noble lord must needs have endeavoured as far as prudence authorised to frustrate an attempt which in conscience he could not approve <\s>
<s> i affirm then that as there was no wrong there is no indignity the present members owe their high situation to circumstances local and national <\s>
<s> they are there because no one else has presented himself or for some years back has been likely to present himself with pretensions the reasonableness of which could enter into competition with their's <\s>
<s> this is in some points of view a misfortune but it is the fact and no class of men regret it more than the independent and judicious adherents of the house of lowther men who are happy and proud to rally round the nobleman who is the head of that house in defence of rational liberty men who know that he has proved himself a faithful guardian to the several orders of the state that he is a tried enemy to dangerous innovations a condemner of fantastic theories one who understands mankind and knows the heights and levels of human nature by which the course of the streams of social action is determined a lover of the people but one who despises as far as relates to his own practice and deplores in respect to that of others the shows and pretences and all the false arts by which the plaudits of the multitude are won and the people flattered to the common ruin of themselves and their deceivers <\s>
<s> but after all let us soberly enquire to what extent it is really an evil that two persons so nearly connected in blood should represent this county <\s>
<s> and first looking at the matter locally what is that portion of england known by the name of the county of westmoreland <\s>
<s> a county which indeed the natives of it love and are justly proud of a region famous for the production of shrewd intelligent brave active honest enterprising men but it covers no very large space on the map the soil is in general barren the country poor accordingly and of necessity thinly inhabited <\s>
<s> there are in england single towns even of a third or fourth rate importance that contain a larger population than is included within the limits of westmoreland from the foot of wrynose to the sides of stainmoor and from the banks of the kent to those of the emont <\s>
<s> is it then to be wondered at considering the antiquity of the house of lowther that circumstances should have raised it to the elevation which it holds in a district so thinly peopled neither rich in the products of agriculture nor in the materials of commerce and where it is impossible that any considerable number of country gentlemen of large or as our ancestors expressed themselves of notable estate can co exist <\s>
<s> it must unavoidably happen therefore that at all times there will be few persons in such a county furnished with the stable requisites of property rank family and personal fitness that shall point them out for such an office and dispose them to covet it by insuring that degree of public confidence which will make them independent comfortable and happy in discharging the duties which it imposes <\s>
<s> this small number will at particular periods be liable to be reduced that this has been the case is apparent upon retrospect and that the number is not large at present may be inferred from the difficulty with which a third candidate has been found and from the insignificant station which the individual who has at length obeyed the call of the discontented holds in the county <\s>
<s> with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully co operated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots <\s>
<s> looking up to the government with respectful attachment we all acknowledge that power must be controlled and checked or it will be abused hence the desirableness of a vigorous opposition in the house of commons and hence a wish grounded upon a conviction of general expediency that the opposition to ministry whose head and chief seat of action are in parliament should be efficaciously diffused through all parts of the country <\s>
<s> on this principle the two grand divisions of party under our free government are founded <\s>
<s> conscience regulated by expediency is the basis honour binding men to each other in spite of temptation is the corner stone and the superstructure is friendship protecting kindness gratitude and all the moral sentiments by which self interest is liberalized <\s>
<s> such is party looked at on the favourable side <\s>
<s> cogent moral inducements therefore exist for the prevalence of two powerful bodies in the practice of the state spreading their influence and interests throughout the country and on political considerations it is desirable that the strength of each should bear such proportion to that of the other that while ministry are able to carry into effect measures not palpably injurious the vigilance of opposition may turn to account being backed by power at all times sufficient to awe but never were that possible except when supported by manifest reason to intimidate <\s>
<s> such apportioning of the strength of the two parties has existed such a degree of power the opposition formerly possessed and if they have lost that salutary power if they are dwindled and divided they must ascribe it to their own errors <\s>
<s> they are weak because they have been unwise they are brought low because when they had solid and high ground to stand upon they took a flight into the air <\s>
<s> to have hoped too ardently of human nature as they did at the commencement of the french revolution was no dishonour to them as men but politicians cannot be allowed to plead temptations of fancy or impulses of feeling in exculpation of mistakes in judgement <\s>
<s> grant however to the enthusiasm of philanthropy as much indulgence as it may call for it is still extraordinary that in the minds of english statesmen and legislators the naked absurdity of the means did not raise a doubt as to the attainableness of the end <\s>
<s> fox captivated by the vanities of a system founded upon abstract rights chaunted his expectations in the house of parliament and too many of his friends partook of the illusion <\s>
<s> the most sagacious politician of his age broke out in an opposite strain <\s>
<s> time has verified his predictions the books remain in which his principles of foreknowledge were laid down but as the author became afterwards a pensioner of state thousands in this country of free opinions persist in asserting that his divination was guess work and that conscience had no part in urging him to speak <\s>
<s> that warning voice proved vain the party from whom he separated proceeded confiding in splendid oratorical talents and ardent feelings rashly wedded to novel expectations when common sense uninquisitive experience and a modest reliance on old habits of judgement when either these or a philosophic penetration were the only qualities that could have served them <\s>
<s> how many private individuals at that period were kept in a rational course by circumstances supplying restraints which their own understandings would not have furnished <\s>
<s> through what fatality it happens that bodies of men are so slow to profit in a similar way by circumstances affecting their prosperity the opposition seem never to have enquired <\s>
<s> they could not avoid observing that the holders of property throughout the country being mostly panic stricken by the proceedings in france turned instinctively against the admirers of the new system and as security for property is the very basis of civil society how was it possible but that reflecting men who perceived this truth should mistrust those representatives of the people who could not have acted less prudently had they been utterly unconscious of it <\s>
<s> but they had committed themselves and did not retract either from unabating devotion to their cause or from false honour and that self injuring consistency the favourite sister of obstinacy which the mixed conscience of mankind is but too apt to produce <\s>
<s> meanwhile the tactics of parliament must continue in exercise on some system or other their adversaries were to be annoyed at any rate and so intent were they upon this that in proportion as the entrenchments of ministry strengthened the assaults of opposition became more careless and desperate <\s>
<s> while the war of words and opinions was going forward in this country europe was deluged with blood <\s>
<s> they in whose hands power was vested among us in course of time lost ground in public opinion through the failure of their efforts <\s>
<s> parties were broken and re composed but men who are brought together less by principle than by events cannot cordially co operate or remain long united <\s>

<s> we submit to the law and to those who are placed in authority over us while in the legitimate exercise of their functions we submit to the decrees of providence because they are not to be resisted a coward submits to be insulted a pusillanimous wretch to be despised and a knave if detected must submit to be scouted a slave submits to his taskmaster but the freeholders of westmoreland cannot in reason be said to submit to the house of lowther naming their representatives unless it can be proved that those representatives have been thrust upon them by an unjustifiable agency and that they owe their seats not to the free suffrages and frank consent of their constituents but to unfair means whether in the shape of seduction or threat <\s>
<s> if there be an indignity on one side there must have been a wrong done on the other and to make out this point it ought to have been shewn that some other person qualified by his property his education his rank and character had stood forth and offered himself to represent you freeholders of westmoreland in parliament and that in this attempt he had been crushed by the power of a single family careless of the mode in which that power was exercised <\s>
<s> i appeal to those who have had an opportunity of being acquainted with the noble lord who is at the head of that family whether they are of opinion that any consideration of his own interest or importance in the state would have induced him to oppose such a candidate provided there was reason for believing that the unabused sense of the county was with him <\s>
<s> if indeed a candidate supposed to be so favoured by the county had declared himself an enemy to the general measures of administration for some years past those measures have depended on principles of conduct of such vast importance that the noble lord must needs have endeavoured as far as prudence authorised to frustrate an attempt which in conscience he could not approve <\s>
<s> i affirm then that as there was no wrong there is no indignity the present members owe their high situation to circumstances local and national <\s>
<s> they are there because no one else has presented himself or for some years back has been likely to present himself with pretensions the reasonableness of which could enter into competition with their's <\s>
<s> this is in some points of view a misfortune but it is the fact and no class of men regret it more than the independent and judicious adherents of the house of lowther men who are happy and proud to rally round the nobleman who is the head of that house in defence of rational liberty men who know that he has proved himself a faithful guardian to the several orders of the state that he is a tried enemy to dangerous innovations a condemner of fantastic theories one who understands mankind and knows the heights and levels of human nature by which the course of the streams of social action is determined a lover of the people but one who despises as far as relates to his own practice and deplores in respect to that of others the shows and pretences and all the false arts by which the plaudits of the multitude are won and the people flattered to the common ruin of themselves and their deceivers <\s>
<s> but after all let us soberly enquire to what extent it is really an evil that two persons so nearly connected in blood should represent this county <\s>
<s> and first looking at the matter locally what is that portion of england known by the name of the county of westmoreland <\s>
<s> a county which indeed the natives of it love and are justly proud of a region famous for the production of shrewd intelligent brave active honest enterprising men but it covers no very large space on the map the soil is in general barren the country poor accordingly and of necessity thinly inhabited <\s>
<s> there are in england single towns even of a third or fourth rate importance that contain a larger population than is included within the limits of westmoreland from the foot of wrynose to the sides of stainmoor and from the banks of the kent to those of the emont <\s>
<s> is it then to be wondered at considering the antiquity of the house of lowther that circumstances should have raised it to the elevation which it holds in a district so thinly peopled neither rich in the products of agriculture nor in the materials of commerce and where it is impossible that any considerable number of country gentlemen of large or as our ancestors expressed themselves of notable estate can co exist <\s>
<s> it must unavoidably happen therefore that at all times there will be few persons in such a county furnished with the stable requisites of property rank family and personal fitness that shall point them out for such an office and dispose them to covet it by insuring that degree of public confidence which will make them independent comfortable and happy in discharging the duties which it imposes <\s>
<s> this small number will at particular periods be liable to be reduced that this has been the case is apparent upon retrospect and that the number is not large at present may be inferred from the difficulty with which a third candidate has been found and from the insignificant station which the individual who has at length obeyed the call of the discontented holds in the county <\s>
<s> with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully co operated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots <\s>
<s> looking up to the government with respectful attachment we all acknowledge that power must be controlled and checked or it will be abused hence the desirableness of a vigorous opposition in the house of commons and hence a wish grounded upon a conviction of general expediency that the opposition to ministry whose head and chief seat of action are in parliament should be efficaciously diffused through all parts of the country <\s>
<s> on this principle the two grand divisions of party under our free government are founded <\s>
<s> conscience regulated by expediency is the basis honour binding men to each other in spite of temptation is the corner stone and the superstructure is friendship protecting kindness gratitude and all the moral sentiments by which self interest is liberalized <\s>
<s> such is party looked at on the favourable side <\s>
<s> cogent moral inducements therefore exist for the prevalence of two powerful bodies in the practice of the state spreading their influence and interests throughout the country and on political considerations it is desirable that the strength of each should bear such proportion to that of the other that while ministry are able to carry into effect measures not palpably injurious the vigilance of opposition may turn to account being backed by power at all times sufficient to awe but never were that possible except when supported by manifest reason to intimidate <\s>
<s> such apportioning of the strength of the two parties has existed such a degree of power the opposition formerly possessed and if they have lost that salutary power if they are dwindled and divided they must ascribe it to their own errors <\s>
<s> they are weak because they have been unwise they are brought low because when they had solid and high ground to stand upon they took a flight into the air <\s>
<s> to have hoped too ardently of human nature as they did at the commencement of the french revolution was no dishonour to them as men but politicians cannot be allowed to plead temptations of fancy or impulses of feeling in exculpation of mistakes in judgement <\s>
<s> grant however to the enthusiasm of philanthropy as much indulgence as it may call for it is still extraordinary that in the minds of english statesmen and legislators the naked absurdity of the means did not raise a doubt as to the attainableness of the end <\s>
<s> fox captivated by the vanities of a system founded upon abstract rights chaunted his expectations in the house of parliament and too many of his friends partook of the illusion <\s>
<s> the most sagacious politician of his age broke out in an opposite strain <\s>
<s> time has verified his predictions the books remain in which his principles of foreknowledge were laid down but as the author became afterwards a pensioner of state thousands in this country of free opinions persist in asserting that his divination was guess work and that conscience had no part in urging him to speak <\s>
<s> that warning voice proved vain the party from whom he separated proceeded confiding in splendid oratorical talents and ardent feelings rashly wedded to novel expectations when common sense uninquisitive experience and a modest reliance on old habits of judgement when either these or a philosophic penetration were the only qualities that could have served them <\s>
<s> how many private individuals at that period were kept in a rational course by circumstances supplying restraints which their own understandings would not have furnished <\s>
<s> through what fatality it happens that bodies of men are so slow to profit in a similar way by circumstances affecting their prosperity the opposition seem never to have enquired <\s>
<s> they could not avoid observing that the holders of property throughout the country being mostly panic stricken by the proceedings in france turned instinctively against the admirers of the new system and as security for property is the very basis of civil society how was it possible but that reflecting men who perceived this truth should mistrust those representatives of the people who could not have acted less prudently had they been utterly unconscious of it <\s>
<s> but they had committed themselves and did not retract either from unabating devotion to their cause or from false honour and that self injuring consistency the favourite sister of obstinacy which the mixed conscience of mankind is but too apt to produce <\s>
<s> meanwhile the tactics of parliament must continue in exercise on some system or other their adversaries were to be annoyed at any rate and so intent were they upon this that in proportion as the entrenchments of ministry strengthened the assaults of opposition became more careless and desperate <\s>
<s> while the war of words and opinions was going forward in this country europe was deluged with blood <\s>
<s> they in whose hands power was vested among us in course of time lost ground in public opinion through the failure of their efforts <\s>
<s> parties were broken and re composed but men who are brought together less by principle than by events cannot cordially co operate or remain long united <\s>
<s> the opponents of the war in this middle stage and desponding state of it were not popular and afterwards when the success of the enemy made the majority of the nation feel that peace dictated by him could not be lasting and they were bent on persevering in the struggle the party of opposition persisted in a course of action which as their countenance of the doctrine of the rights of man had brought their understandings into disrepute cast suspicion on the soundness of their patriotic affections <\s>
<s> their passions made them blind to the differences between a state of peace and war above all such a war as prescribing rules for their own conduct <\s>
<s> they were ignorant or never bore in mind that a species of hostility which had there been no foreign enemy to resist might have proved useful and honourable became equally pernicious and disgraceful when a formidable foe threatened us with destruction <\s>
<s> i appeal to impartial recollection whether during the course of the late awful struggle and in the latter stages of it especially the antagonists of ministers in the two houses of parliament did not for the most part conduct themselves more like allies to a military despot who was attempting to enslave the world and to whom their own country was an object of paramount hatred than like honest englishmen who had breathed the air of liberty from their cradles <\s>
<s> if any state of things could supply them with motives for acting in that manner they must abide by the consequences <\s>
<s> they must reconcile themselves as well as they can to dislike and to disesteem the unavoidable results of behaviour so unnatural <\s>
<s> peace has indeed come but do they who deprecated the continuance of the war and clamoured for its close on any terms rejoice heartily in a triumph by which their prophecies were belied <\s>
<s> did they lend their voices to swell the hymn of transport that resounded through our land when the arch enemy was overthrown <\s>
<s> are they pleased that inheritances have been restored and that legitimate governments have been re established on the continent <\s>
<s> and do they grieve when those re established governments act unworthily of the favour which providence has shown them <\s>
<s> do not too many rather secretly congratulate themselves on every proof of imbecility or misconduct there exhibited and endeavour that attention shall be exclusively fixed on those melancholy facts as if they were the only fruits of a triumph to which we britons owe that we are a fearless undishonoured and rapidly improving people and the nations of the continent owe their very existence as self governed communities <\s>
<s> the party of opposition or what remains of it has much to repent of many humiliating reflections must pass through the minds of those who compose it and they must learn the hard lesson to be thankful for them as a discipline indispensible to their amendment <\s>
<s> thus only can they furnish a sufficient nucleus for the formation of a new body nor can there be any hope of such body being adequate to its appropriate service and of its possessing that portion of good opinion which shall entitle it to the respect of its antagonists unless it live and act for a length of time under a distinct conception of the kind and degree of hostility to the executive government which is fairly warrantable <\s>
<s> the party must cease indiscriminately to court the discontented and to league itself with men who are athirst for innovation to a point which leaves it doubtful whether an opposition that is willing to co operate with such agitators loves as it ought to do and becomingly venerates the happy and glorious constitution in church and state which we have inherited from our ancestors <\s>
<s> till not a doubt can be left that this indispensible change has been effected freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> you will remain but to exhort is not my present business i was retracing the history of the influence of one family and have shewn that much of it depends upon that steady support given by them to government during a long and arduous struggle and upon the general course of their public conduct which has secured your approbation and won for them your confidence <\s>
<s> let us now candidly ask what practical evil has arisen from this preponderance <\s>
<s> is it not obvious that it is justified by the causes that have produced it <\s>
<s> as far as it concerns the general well being of the kingdom it would be easy to shew that if the democratic activities of the great towns and of the manufacturing districts were not counteracted by the sedentary power of large estates continued from generation to generation in particular families it would be scarcely possible that the laws and constitution of the country could sustain the shocks which they would be subject to <\s>
<s> and as to our own county that man must be strangely prejudiced who does not perceive how desireable it is that some powerful individual should he attached to it who by his influence with government may facilitate the execution of any plan tending with due concern for general welfare to the especial benefit of westmoreland <\s>
<s> the influence of the house of lowther is we acknowledge great but has a case been made out that this influence has been abused <\s>
<s> the voice of gratitude is not loud out of delicacy to the benefactor but if all who know were at liberty to speak to the measure of their wishes the services which have been rendered by the house of lowther to westmoreland its natives and inhabitants would be proclaimed in a manner that would confound detraction yet the kendal committee of the 26th of january without troubling themselves to inquire how far this preponderance is a reasonable thing and what have been its real and practical effects are indignant their blood is roused and they are determined to address their brother freeholders and call upon them to recover the exercise of the elective franchise which has been withheld from them for half a century withheld from them <\s>
<s> suppose these champions in this their first declaration of hostility had said to recover the elective franchise which we have suffered to lie dormant <\s>
<s> but no who would take blame to himself when by so doing he is likely to break the force of the indignation which whether deserved or not he hopes to heap upon his adversary <\s>
<s> this is politic but does it become professing men <\s>
<s> does it suit those who set forward with a proclamation that they are select spirits free from party ties and of course superior to those artifices and misrepresentations to those groundless or immoderate aversions which men who act in parties find it so difficult to keep clear of <\s>
<s> what degree of discernment and consistency an assembly of persons who begin their labours with such professions and publish such intentions have shewn by making choice of the individual whom they have recommended as eminently entitled to their confidence and qualified to assist them in attaining their end may become the fit subject of a future enquiry <\s>
<s> so these states have been called <\s>
<s> they are weaknesses a true though ill sounding title and not powers <\s>
<s> polybius tells us that hannibal entered into italy with twenty thousand men and that the aggregate forces of italy at that time amounted to seven hundred and sixty thousand foot and horse with the roman discipline and power to head that mighty force <\s>
<s> gustavus adolphus invaded germany with thirteen thousand men the emperor at that time having between two and three hundred thousand warlike and experienced troops commanded by able generals to oppose to him <\s>
<s> let these facts and numerous others which history supplies of the same kind be thought of and let us hear no more of the impossibility of great britain girt round and defended by the sea and an invincible navy becoming a military power great britain whose troops surpass in valour those of all the world and who has an army and a militia of upwards of three hundred thousand men <\s>
<s> do reflect my dear sir upon the materials which are now in preparation upon the continent <\s>
<s> hannibal expected to be joined by a parcel of the contented barbarian gauls in the north of italy <\s>
<s> gustavus stood forth as the champion of the protestant interest how feeble and limited each of these auxiliary sentiments and powers compared with what the state of knowledge the oppressions of their domestic governments and the insults and injuries and hostile cruelties inflicted by the french upon the continental nations must have exerted to second our arms whenever we shall appear in that force which we can assume and with that boldness which would become us and which justice and human nature and patriotism call upon us to put forth <\s>

<s> two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> on the occasion of these two addresses and other related matters see preface in the present volume <\s>
<s> two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> kendal printed by airey and bellingham <\s>
<s> the author thinks it proper to advise his reader that he alone is responsible for the sentiments and opinions expressed in these sheets <\s>
<s> gladly would he have availed himself of the judgment of others if that benefit could have been had without subjecting the persons consulted to the possibility of blame for having sanctioned any view of the topics under consideration which either from its erroneousness might deserve or from party feelings or other causes might incur censure <\s>
<s> the matter comprised in these pages was intended to compose a succession of addresses to be printed in the kendal chronicle and a part of the first was published through that channel <\s>
<s> the intention was dropped for reasons well known <\s>
<s> it is now mentioned in order to account for the disproportion in the length of the two addresses and an arrangement of matter in some places different from what would otherwise have been chosen <\s>
<s> a portion also has appeared in the carlisle patriot <\s>
<s> it is of little importance to add that this publication has been delayed by unavoidable engagements of the printer <\s>
<s> the new candidate has appeared amongst us and concluded for the present his labours in the county <\s>
<s> they require no further notice here than an expression of thanks for the success with which he has co operated with the author of these pages to demonstrate by the whole of his itinerant proceedings that the vital principle of the opposition ostensibly headed by him is at enmity with the bonds by which society is held together and government maintained <\s>
<s> to the freeholders c <\s>
<s> gentlemen two months have elapsed since warning was given of an intention to oppose the present representatives of the county of westmoreland at the ensuing election yet till so late a period as the 26th of january no avowal of such intention appeared from any quarter entitling it to consideration <\s>
<s> for as to the body of men calling itself the london committee there is not up to this hour i believe any public evidence even of its existence except certain notices signed by two obscure individuals <\s>
<s> but in the minds of those naturally interested in the welfare of the county a ferment was excited by various devices inflammatory addresses were busily circulated men laying claim to the flattering character of reformers of abuses became active and as this stir did not die away they who foresaw its bearings and tendencies were desirous that if there were any just grounds for discontent the same should be openly declared by persons whose characters and situations in life would be a pledge for their having proceeded upon mature deliberation <\s>
<s> at length a set of resolutions have appeared from a meeting of dissatisfied freeholders holden in a town which if not the principal in point of rank is the most populous opulent and weighty in the county <\s>
<s> among those who composed this meeting the first visible authentic body which the opposition has produced are to be found persons answering to the description above given men from whom might have been expected in the exposition of their complaints sound sense as to the nature of the grievances and rational views as to the mode of removing them have such expectations if entertained been fulfilled <\s>
<s> the first resolution unanimously agreed upon by this meeting is couched in these words it is impossible for us as freeholders to submit any longer to a single family however respectable naming both members for the county <\s>
<s> what if this leading article had been thus expressed <\s>
<s> that it is injurious to the interests and derogatory to the dignity of the county of westmoreland that both its representatives should be brought into parliament by the influence of one family <\s>
<s> words to this effect would surely have given the sense of the resolution as proceeding from men of cool reflection and offered nakedly to the consideration of minds which it was desired should be kept in a similar state <\s>
<s> but we cannot submit any longer' if the intention was to mislead and irritate such language was well adapted for the purpose but it ill accords with the spirit of the next resolution which affirms that the meeting is wholly unconnected with any political party and thus disclaiming indirectly those passions and prejudices that are apt to fasten upon political partisans implicitly promises that the opinions of the meeting shall be conveyed in terms suitable to such disavowal <\s>
<s> did the persons in question imagine themselves in a state of degradation <\s>
<s> on their own word we must believe they did and no one could object to their employing among each other such language as gave vent to feelings proceeding from that impression in a way that gratified themselves <\s>
<s> but by publishing their resolutions they shew that they are not communing for the sake of mutual sympathy but to induce others to participate a sentiment which probably they are strangers to <\s>
<s> we submit to the law and to those who are placed in authority over us while in the legitimate exercise of their functions we submit to the decrees of providence because they are not to be resisted a coward submits to be insulted a pusillanimous wretch to be despised and a knave if detected must submit to be scouted a slave submits to his taskmaster but the freeholders of westmoreland cannot in reason be said to submit to the house of lowther naming their representatives unless it can be proved that those representatives have been thrust upon them by an unjustifiable agency and that they owe their seats not to the free suffrages and frank consent of their constituents but to unfair means whether in the shape of seduction or threat <\s>
<s> if there be an indignity on one side there must have been a wrong done on the other and to make out this point it ought to have been shewn that some other person qualified by his property his education his rank and character had stood forth and offered himself to represent you freeholders of westmoreland in parliament and that in this attempt he had been crushed by the power of a single family careless of the mode in which that power was exercised <\s>
<s> i appeal to those who have had an opportunity of being acquainted with the noble lord who is at the head of that family whether they are of opinion that any consideration of his own interest or importance in the state would have induced him to oppose such a candidate provided there was reason for believing that the unabused sense of the county was with him <\s>
<s> if indeed a candidate supposed to be so favoured by the county had declared himself an enemy to the general measures of administration for some years past those measures have depended on principles of conduct of such vast importance that the noble lord must needs have endeavoured as far as prudence authorised to frustrate an attempt which in conscience he could not approve <\s>
<s> i affirm then that as there was no wrong there is no indignity the present members owe their high situation to circumstances local and national <\s>
<s> they are there because no one else has presented himself or for some years back has been likely to present himself with pretensions the reasonableness of which could enter into competition with their's <\s>

<s> with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully co operated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots <\s>
<s> looking up to the government with respectful attachment we all acknowledge that power must be controlled and checked or it will be abused hence the desirableness of a vigorous opposition in the house of commons and hence a wish grounded upon a conviction of general expediency that the opposition to ministry whose head and chief seat of action are in parliament should be efficaciously diffused through all parts of the country <\s>

<s> the voice of gratitude is not loud out of delicacy to the benefactor but if all who know were at liberty to speak to the measure of their wishes the services which have been rendered by the house of lowther to westmoreland its natives and inhabitants would be proclaimed in a manner that would confound detraction yet the kendal committee of the 26th of january without troubling themselves to inquire how far this preponderance is a reasonable thing and what have been its real and practical effects are indignant their blood is roused and they are determined to address their brother freeholders and call upon them to recover the exercise of the elective franchise which has been withheld from them for half a century withheld from them <\s>
<s> suppose these champions in this their first declaration of hostility had said to recover the elective franchise which we have suffered to lie dormant <\s>

<s> this is politic but does it become professing men <\s>

<s> what degree of discernment and consistency an assembly of persons who begin their labours with such professions and publish such intentions have shewn by making choice of the individual whom they have recommended as eminently entitled to their confidence and qualified to assist them in attaining their end may become the fit subject of a future enquiry <\s>
<s> so these states have been called <\s>
<s> they are weaknesses a true though ill sounding title and not powers <\s>
<s> polybius tells us that hannibal entered into italy with twenty thousand men and that the aggregate forces of italy at that time amounted to seven hundred and sixty thousand foot and horse with the roman discipline and power to head that mighty force <\s>
<s> gustavus adolphus invaded germany with thirteen thousand men the emperor at that time having between two and three hundred thousand warlike and experienced troops commanded by able generals to oppose to him <\s>
<s> let these facts and numerous others which history supplies of the same kind be thought of and let us hear no more of the impossibility of great britain girt round and defended by the sea and an invincible navy becoming a military power great britain whose troops surpass in valour those of all the world and who has an army and a militia of upwards of three hundred thousand men <\s>
<s> do reflect my dear sir upon the materials which are now in preparation upon the continent <\s>
<s> hannibal expected to be joined by a parcel of the contented barbarian gauls in the north of italy <\s>
<s> gustavus stood forth as the champion of the protestant interest how feeble and limited each of these auxiliary sentiments and powers compared with what the state of knowledge the oppressions of their domestic governments and the insults and injuries and hostile cruelties inflicted by the french upon the continental nations must have exerted to second our arms whenever we shall appear in that force which we can assume and with that boldness which would become us and which justice and human nature and patriotism call upon us to put forth <\s>

<s> two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> on the occasion of these two addresses and other related matters see preface in the present volume <\s>
<s> two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> kendal printed by airey and bellingham <\s>
<s> the author thinks it proper to advise his reader that he alone is responsible for the sentiments and opinions expressed in these sheets <\s>
<s> gladly would he have availed himself of the judgment of others if that benefit could have been had without subjecting the persons consulted to the possibility of blame for having sanctioned any view of the topics under consideration which either from its erroneousness might deserve or from party feelings or other causes might incur censure <\s>
<s> the matter comprised in these pages was intended to compose a succession of addresses to be printed in the kendal chronicle and a part of the first was published through that channel <\s>
<s> the intention was dropped for reasons well known <\s>
<s> it is now mentioned in order to account for the disproportion in the length of the two addresses and an arrangement of matter in some places different from what would otherwise have been chosen <\s>
<s> a portion also has appeared in the carlisle patriot <\s>
<s> it is of little importance to add that this publication has been delayed by unavoidable engagements of the printer <\s>
<s> the new candidate has appeared amongst us and concluded for the present his labours in the county <\s>
<s> they require no further notice here than an expression of thanks for the success with which he has co operated with the author of these pages to demonstrate by the whole of his itinerant proceedings that the vital principle of the opposition ostensibly headed by him is at enmity with the bonds by which society is held together and government maintained <\s>
<s> to the freeholders c <\s>
<s> gentlemen two months have elapsed since warning was given of an intention to oppose the present representatives of the county of westmoreland at the ensuing election yet till so late a period as the 26th of january no avowal of such intention appeared from any quarter entitling it to consideration <\s>
<s> for as to the body of men calling itself the london committee there is not up to this hour i believe any public evidence even of its existence except certain notices signed by two obscure individuals <\s>
<s> but in the minds of those naturally interested in the welfare of the county a ferment was excited by various devices inflammatory addresses were busily circulated men laying claim to the flattering character of reformers of abuses became active and as this stir did not die away they who foresaw its bearings and tendencies were desirous that if there were any just grounds for discontent the same should be openly declared by persons whose characters and situations in life would be a pledge for their having proceeded upon mature deliberation <\s>
<s> at length a set of resolutions have appeared from a meeting of dissatisfied freeholders holden in a town which if not the principal in point of rank is the most populous opulent and weighty in the county <\s>
<s> among those who composed this meeting the first visible authentic body which the opposition has produced are to be found persons answering to the description above given men from whom might have been expected in the exposition of their complaints sound sense as to the nature of the grievances and rational views as to the mode of removing them have such expectations if entertained been fulfilled <\s>
<s> the first resolution unanimously agreed upon by this meeting is couched in these words it is impossible for us as freeholders to submit any longer to a single family however respectable naming both members for the county <\s>
<s> what if this leading article had been thus expressed <\s>
<s> that it is injurious to the interests and derogatory to the dignity of the county of westmoreland that both its representatives should be brought into parliament by the influence of one family <\s>
<s> words to this effect would surely have given the sense of the resolution as proceeding from men of cool reflection and offered nakedly to the consideration of minds which it was desired should be kept in a similar state <\s>
<s> but we cannot submit any longer' if the intention was to mislead and irritate such language was well adapted for the purpose but it ill accords with the spirit of the next resolution which affirms that the meeting is wholly unconnected with any political party and thus disclaiming indirectly those passions and prejudices that are apt to fasten upon political partisans implicitly promises that the opinions of the meeting shall be conveyed in terms suitable to such disavowal <\s>
<s> did the persons in question imagine themselves in a state of degradation <\s>
<s> on their own word we must believe they did and no one could object to their employing among each other such language as gave vent to feelings proceeding from that impression in a way that gratified themselves <\s>
<s> but by publishing their resolutions they shew that they are not communing for the sake of mutual sympathy but to induce others to participate a sentiment which probably they are strangers to <\s>
<s> we submit to the law and to those who are placed in authority over us while in the legitimate exercise of their functions we submit to the decrees of providence because they are not to be resisted a coward submits to be insulted a pusillanimous wretch to be despised and a knave if detected must submit to be scouted a slave submits to his taskmaster but the freeholders of westmoreland cannot in reason be said to submit to the house of lowther naming their representatives unless it can be proved that those representatives have been thrust upon them by an unjustifiable agency and that they owe their seats not to the free suffrages and frank consent of their constituents but to unfair means whether in the shape of seduction or threat <\s>
<s> if there be an indignity on one side there must have been a wrong done on the other and to make out this point it ought to have been shewn that some other person qualified by his property his education his rank and character had stood forth and offered himself to represent you freeholders of westmoreland in parliament and that in this attempt he had been crushed by the power of a single family careless of the mode in which that power was exercised <\s>
<s> i appeal to those who have had an opportunity of being acquainted with the noble lord who is at the head of that family whether they are of opinion that any consideration of his own interest or importance in the state would have induced him to oppose such a candidate provided there was reason for believing that the unabused sense of the county was with him <\s>
<s> if indeed a candidate supposed to be so favoured by the county had declared himself an enemy to the general measures of administration for some years past those measures have depended on principles of conduct of such vast importance that the noble lord must needs have endeavoured as far as prudence authorised to frustrate an attempt which in conscience he could not approve <\s>
<s> i affirm then that as there was no wrong there is no indignity the present members owe their high situation to circumstances local and national <\s>
<s> they are there because no one else has presented himself or for some years back has been likely to present himself with pretensions the reasonableness of which could enter into competition with their's <\s>
<s> this is in some points of view a misfortune but it is the fact and no class of men regret it more than the independent and judicious adherents of the house of lowther men who are happy and proud to rally round the nobleman who is the head of that house in defence of rational liberty men who know that he has proved himself a faithful guardian to the several orders of the state that he is a tried enemy to dangerous innovations a condemner of fantastic theories one who understands mankind and knows the heights and levels of human nature by which the course of the streams of social action is determined a lover of the people but one who despises as far as relates to his own practice and deplores in respect to that of others the shows and pretences and all the false arts by which the plaudits of the multitude are won and the people flattered to the common ruin of themselves and their deceivers <\s>
<s> but after all let us soberly enquire to what extent it is really an evil that two persons so nearly connected in blood should represent this county <\s>
<s> and first looking at the matter locally what is that portion of england known by the name of the county of westmoreland <\s>
<s> a county which indeed the natives of it love and are justly proud of a region famous for the production of shrewd intelligent brave active honest enterprising men but it covers no very large space on the map the soil is in general barren the country poor accordingly and of necessity thinly inhabited <\s>
<s> there are in england single towns even of a third or fourth rate importance that contain a larger population than is included within the limits of westmoreland from the foot of wrynose to the sides of stainmoor and from the banks of the kent to those of the emont <\s>
<s> is it then to be wondered at considering the antiquity of the house of lowther that circumstances should have raised it to the elevation which it holds in a district so thinly peopled neither rich in the products of agriculture nor in the materials of commerce and where it is impossible that any considerable number of country gentlemen of large or as our ancestors expressed themselves of notable estate can co exist <\s>
<s> it must unavoidably happen therefore that at all times there will be few persons in such a county furnished with the stable requisites of property rank family and personal fitness that shall point them out for such an office and dispose them to covet it by insuring that degree of public confidence which will make them independent comfortable and happy in discharging the duties which it imposes <\s>
<s> this small number will at particular periods be liable to be reduced that this has been the case is apparent upon retrospect and that the number is not large at present may be inferred from the difficulty with which a third candidate has been found and from the insignificant station which the individual who has at length obeyed the call of the discontented holds in the county <\s>
<s> with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully co operated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots <\s>
<s> looking up to the government with respectful attachment we all acknowledge that power must be controlled and checked or it will be abused hence the desirableness of a vigorous opposition in the house of commons and hence a wish grounded upon a conviction of general expediency that the opposition to ministry whose head and chief seat of action are in parliament should be efficaciously diffused through all parts of the country <\s>
<s> on this principle the two grand divisions of party under our free government are founded <\s>
<s> conscience regulated by expediency is the basis honour binding men to each other in spite of temptation is the corner stone and the superstructure is friendship protecting kindness gratitude and all the moral sentiments by which self interest is liberalized <\s>
<s> such is party looked at on the favourable side <\s>
<s> cogent moral inducements therefore exist for the prevalence of two powerful bodies in the practice of the state spreading their influence and interests throughout the country and on political considerations it is desirable that the strength of each should bear such proportion to that of the other that while ministry are able to carry into effect measures not palpably injurious the vigilance of opposition may turn to account being backed by power at all times sufficient to awe but never were that possible except when supported by manifest reason to intimidate <\s>
<s> such apportioning of the strength of the two parties has existed such a degree of power the opposition formerly possessed and if they have lost that salutary power if they are dwindled and divided they must ascribe it to their own errors <\s>
<s> they are weak because they have been unwise they are brought low because when they had solid and high ground to stand upon they took a flight into the air <\s>
<s> to have hoped too ardently of human nature as they did at the commencement of the french revolution was no dishonour to them as men but politicians cannot be allowed to plead temptations of fancy or impulses of feeling in exculpation of mistakes in judgement <\s>
<s> grant however to the enthusiasm of philanthropy as much indulgence as it may call for it is still extraordinary that in the minds of english statesmen and legislators the naked absurdity of the means did not raise a doubt as to the attainableness of the end <\s>
<s> fox captivated by the vanities of a system founded upon abstract rights chaunted his expectations in the house of parliament and too many of his friends partook of the illusion <\s>
<s> the most sagacious politician of his age broke out in an opposite strain <\s>
<s> time has verified his predictions the books remain in which his principles of foreknowledge were laid down but as the author became afterwards a pensioner of state thousands in this country of free opinions persist in asserting that his divination was guess work and that conscience had no part in urging him to speak <\s>
<s> that warning voice proved vain the party from whom he separated proceeded confiding in splendid oratorical talents and ardent feelings rashly wedded to novel expectations when common sense uninquisitive experience and a modest reliance on old habits of judgement when either these or a philosophic penetration were the only qualities that could have served them <\s>
<s> how many private individuals at that period were kept in a rational course by circumstances supplying restraints which their own understandings would not have furnished <\s>
<s> through what fatality it happens that bodies of men are so slow to profit in a similar way by circumstances affecting their prosperity the opposition seem never to have enquired <\s>
<s> they could not avoid observing that the holders of property throughout the country being mostly panic stricken by the proceedings in france turned instinctively against the admirers of the new system and as security for property is the very basis of civil society how was it possible but that reflecting men who perceived this truth should mistrust those representatives of the people who could not have acted less prudently had they been utterly unconscious of it <\s>
<s> but they had committed themselves and did not retract either from unabating devotion to their cause or from false honour and that self injuring consistency the favourite sister of obstinacy which the mixed conscience of mankind is but too apt to produce <\s>
<s> meanwhile the tactics of parliament must continue in exercise on some system or other their adversaries were to be annoyed at any rate and so intent were they upon this that in proportion as the entrenchments of ministry strengthened the assaults of opposition became more careless and desperate <\s>
<s> while the war of words and opinions was going forward in this country europe was deluged with blood <\s>
<s> they in whose hands power was vested among us in course of time lost ground in public opinion through the failure of their efforts <\s>
<s> parties were broken and re composed but men who are brought together less by principle than by events cannot cordially co operate or remain long united <\s>
<s> the opponents of the war in this middle stage and desponding state of it were not popular and afterwards when the success of the enemy made the majority of the nation feel that peace dictated by him could not be lasting and they were bent on persevering in the struggle the party of opposition persisted in a course of action which as their countenance of the doctrine of the rights of man had brought their understandings into disrepute cast suspicion on the soundness of their patriotic affections <\s>
<s> their passions made them blind to the differences between a state of peace and war above all such a war as prescribing rules for their own conduct <\s>
<s> they were ignorant or never bore in mind that a species of hostility which had there been no foreign enemy to resist might have proved useful and honourable became equally pernicious and disgraceful when a formidable foe threatened us with destruction <\s>
<s> i appeal to impartial recollection whether during the course of the late awful struggle and in the latter stages of it especially the antagonists of ministers in the two houses of parliament did not for the most part conduct themselves more like allies to a military despot who was attempting to enslave the world and to whom their own country was an object of paramount hatred than like honest englishmen who had breathed the air of liberty from their cradles <\s>
<s> if any state of things could supply them with motives for acting in that manner they must abide by the consequences <\s>
<s> they must reconcile themselves as well as they can to dislike and to disesteem the unavoidable results of behaviour so unnatural <\s>
<s> peace has indeed come but do they who deprecated the continuance of the war and clamoured for its close on any terms rejoice heartily in a triumph by which their prophecies were belied <\s>
<s> did they lend their voices to swell the hymn of transport that resounded through our land when the arch enemy was overthrown <\s>
<s> are they pleased that inheritances have been restored and that legitimate governments have been re established on the continent <\s>
<s> and do they grieve when those re established governments act unworthily of the favour which providence has shown them <\s>
<s> do not too many rather secretly congratulate themselves on every proof of imbecility or misconduct there exhibited and endeavour that attention shall be exclusively fixed on those melancholy facts as if they were the only fruits of a triumph to which we britons owe that we are a fearless undishonoured and rapidly improving people and the nations of the continent owe their very existence as self governed communities <\s>
<s> the party of opposition or what remains of it has much to repent of many humiliating reflections must pass through the minds of those who compose it and they must learn the hard lesson to be thankful for them as a discipline indispensible to their amendment <\s>
<s> thus only can they furnish a sufficient nucleus for the formation of a new body nor can there be any hope of such body being adequate to its appropriate service and of its possessing that portion of good opinion which shall entitle it to the respect of its antagonists unless it live and act for a length of time under a distinct conception of the kind and degree of hostility to the executive government which is fairly warrantable <\s>
<s> the party must cease indiscriminately to court the discontented and to league itself with men who are athirst for innovation to a point which leaves it doubtful whether an opposition that is willing to co operate with such agitators loves as it ought to do and becomingly venerates the happy and glorious constitution in church and state which we have inherited from our ancestors <\s>
<s> till not a doubt can be left that this indispensible change has been effected freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> you will remain but to exhort is not my present business i was retracing the history of the influence of one family and have shewn that much of it depends upon that steady support given by them to government during a long and arduous struggle and upon the general course of their public conduct which has secured your approbation and won for them your confidence <\s>
<s> let us now candidly ask what practical evil has arisen from this preponderance <\s>
<s> is it not obvious that it is justified by the causes that have produced it <\s>
<s> as far as it concerns the general well being of the kingdom it would be easy to shew that if the democratic activities of the great towns and of the manufacturing districts were not counteracted by the sedentary power of large estates continued from generation to generation in particular families it would be scarcely possible that the laws and constitution of the country could sustain the shocks which they would be subject to <\s>
<s> and as to our own county that man must be strangely prejudiced who does not perceive how desireable it is that some powerful individual should he attached to it who by his influence with government may facilitate the execution of any plan tending with due concern for general welfare to the especial benefit of westmoreland <\s>
<s> the influence of the house of lowther is we acknowledge great but has a case been made out that this influence has been abused <\s>
<s> the voice of gratitude is not loud out of delicacy to the benefactor but if all who know were at liberty to speak to the measure of their wishes the services which have been rendered by the house of lowther to westmoreland its natives and inhabitants would be proclaimed in a manner that would confound detraction yet the kendal committee of the 26th of january without troubling themselves to inquire how far this preponderance is a reasonable thing and what have been its real and practical effects are indignant their blood is roused and they are determined to address their brother freeholders and call upon them to recover the exercise of the elective franchise which has been withheld from them for half a century withheld from them <\s>
<s> suppose these champions in this their first declaration of hostility had said to recover the elective franchise which we have suffered to lie dormant <\s>
<s> but no who would take blame to himself when by so doing he is likely to break the force of the indignation which whether deserved or not he hopes to heap upon his adversary <\s>
<s> this is politic but does it become professing men <\s>
<s> does it suit those who set forward with a proclamation that they are select spirits free from party ties and of course superior to those artifices and misrepresentations to those groundless or immoderate aversions which men who act in parties find it so difficult to keep clear of <\s>
<s> what degree of discernment and consistency an assembly of persons who begin their labours with such professions and publish such intentions have shewn by making choice of the individual whom they have recommended as eminently entitled to their confidence and qualified to assist them in attaining their end may become the fit subject of a future enquiry <\s>
<s> so these states have been called <\s>
<s> they are weaknesses a true though ill sounding title and not powers <\s>
<s> polybius tells us that hannibal entered into italy with twenty thousand men and that the aggregate forces of italy at that time amounted to seven hundred and sixty thousand foot and horse with the roman discipline and power to head that mighty force <\s>
<s> gustavus adolphus invaded germany with thirteen thousand men the emperor at that time having between two and three hundred thousand warlike and experienced troops commanded by able generals to oppose to him <\s>
<s> let these facts and numerous others which history supplies of the same kind be thought of and let us hear no more of the impossibility of great britain girt round and defended by the sea and an invincible navy becoming a military power great britain whose troops surpass in valour those of all the world and who has an army and a militia of upwards of three hundred thousand men <\s>
<s> do reflect my dear sir upon the materials which are now in preparation upon the continent <\s>
<s> hannibal expected to be joined by a parcel of the contented barbarian gauls in the north of italy <\s>
<s> gustavus stood forth as the champion of the protestant interest how feeble and limited each of these auxiliary sentiments and powers compared with what the state of knowledge the oppressions of their domestic governments and the insults and injuries and hostile cruelties inflicted by the french upon the continental nations must have exerted to second our arms whenever we shall appear in that force which we can assume and with that boldness which would become us and which justice and human nature and patriotism call upon us to put forth <\s>

<s> with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully co operated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots <\s>
<s> looking up to the government with respectful attachment we all acknowledge that power must be controlled and checked or it will be abused hence the desirableness of a vigorous opposition in the house of commons and hence a wish grounded upon a conviction of general expediency that the opposition to ministry whose head and chief seat of action are in parliament should be efficaciously diffused through all parts of the country <\s>
<s> on this principle the two grand divisions of party under our free government are founded <\s>
<s> conscience regulated by expediency is the basis honour binding men to each other in spite of temptation is the corner stone and the superstructure is friendship protecting kindness gratitude and all the moral sentiments by which self interest is liberalized <\s>
<s> such is party looked at on the favourable side <\s>
<s> cogent moral inducements therefore exist for the prevalence of two powerful bodies in the practice of the state spreading their influence and interests throughout the country and on political considerations it is desirable that the strength of each should bear such proportion to that of the other that while ministry are able to carry into effect measures not palpably injurious the vigilance of opposition may turn to account being backed by power at all times sufficient to awe but never were that possible except when supported by manifest reason to intimidate <\s>
<s> such apportioning of the strength of the two parties has existed such a degree of power the opposition formerly possessed and if they have lost that salutary power if they are dwindled and divided they must ascribe it to their own errors <\s>
<s> they are weak because they have been unwise they are brought low because when they had solid and high ground to stand upon they took a flight into the air <\s>
<s> to have hoped too ardently of human nature as they did at the commencement of the french revolution was no dishonour to them as men but politicians cannot be allowed to plead temptations of fancy or impulses of feeling in exculpation of mistakes in judgement <\s>
<s> grant however to the enthusiasm of philanthropy as much indulgence as it may call for it is still extraordinary that in the minds of english statesmen and legislators the naked absurdity of the means did not raise a doubt as to the attainableness of the end <\s>
<s> fox captivated by the vanities of a system founded upon abstract rights chaunted his expectations in the house of parliament and too many of his friends partook of the illusion <\s>
<s> the most sagacious politician of his age broke out in an opposite strain <\s>
<s> time has verified his predictions the books remain in which his principles of foreknowledge were laid down but as the author became afterwards a pensioner of state thousands in this country of free opinions persist in asserting that his divination was guess work and that conscience had no part in urging him to speak <\s>
<s> that warning voice proved vain the party from whom he separated proceeded confiding in splendid oratorical talents and ardent feelings rashly wedded to novel expectations when common sense uninquisitive experience and a modest reliance on old habits of judgement when either these or a philosophic penetration were the only qualities that could have served them <\s>
<s> how many private individuals at that period were kept in a rational course by circumstances supplying restraints which their own understandings would not have furnished <\s>
<s> through what fatality it happens that bodies of men are so slow to profit in a similar way by circumstances affecting their prosperity the opposition seem never to have enquired <\s>
<s> they could not avoid observing that the holders of property throughout the country being mostly panic stricken by the proceedings in france turned instinctively against the admirers of the new system and as security for property is the very basis of civil society how was it possible but that reflecting men who perceived this truth should mistrust those representatives of the people who could not have acted less prudently had they been utterly unconscious of it <\s>
<s> but they had committed themselves and did not retract either from unabating devotion to their cause or from false honour and that self injuring consistency the favourite sister of obstinacy which the mixed conscience of mankind is but too apt to produce <\s>
<s> meanwhile the tactics of parliament must continue in exercise on some system or other their adversaries were to be annoyed at any rate and so intent were they upon this that in proportion as the entrenchments of ministry strengthened the assaults of opposition became more careless and desperate <\s>
<s> while the war of words and opinions was going forward in this country europe was deluged with blood <\s>
<s> they in whose hands power was vested among us in course of time lost ground in public opinion through the failure of their efforts <\s>
<s> parties were broken and re composed but men who are brought together less by principle than by events cannot cordially co operate or remain long united <\s>
<s> the opponents of the war in this middle stage and desponding state of it were not popular and afterwards when the success of the enemy made the majority of the nation feel that peace dictated by him could not be lasting and they were bent on persevering in the struggle the party of opposition persisted in a course of action which as their countenance of the doctrine of the rights of man had brought their understandings into disrepute cast suspicion on the soundness of their patriotic affections <\s>
<s> their passions made them blind to the differences between a state of peace and war above all such a war as prescribing rules for their own conduct <\s>
<s> they were ignorant or never bore in mind that a species of hostility which had there been no foreign enemy to resist might have proved useful and honourable became equally pernicious and disgraceful when a formidable foe threatened us with destruction <\s>
<s> i appeal to impartial recollection whether during the course of the late awful struggle and in the latter stages of it especially the antagonists of ministers in the two houses of parliament did not for the most part conduct themselves more like allies to a military despot who was attempting to enslave the world and to whom their own country was an object of paramount hatred than like honest englishmen who had breathed the air of liberty from their cradles <\s>
<s> if any state of things could supply them with motives for acting in that manner they must abide by the consequences <\s>
<s> they must reconcile themselves as well as they can to dislike and to disesteem the unavoidable results of behaviour so unnatural <\s>
<s> peace has indeed come but do they who deprecated the continuance of the war and clamoured for its close on any terms rejoice heartily in a triumph by which their prophecies were belied <\s>
<s> did they lend their voices to swell the hymn of transport that resounded through our land when the arch enemy was overthrown <\s>
<s> are they pleased that inheritances have been restored and that legitimate governments have been re established on the continent <\s>
<s> and do they grieve when those re established governments act unworthily of the favour which providence has shown them <\s>
<s> do not too many rather secretly congratulate themselves on every proof of imbecility or misconduct there exhibited and endeavour that attention shall be exclusively fixed on those melancholy facts as if they were the only fruits of a triumph to which we britons owe that we are a fearless undishonoured and rapidly improving people and the nations of the continent owe their very existence as self governed communities <\s>
<s> the party of opposition or what remains of it has much to repent of many humiliating reflections must pass through the minds of those who compose it and they must learn the hard lesson to be thankful for them as a discipline indispensible to their amendment <\s>
<s> thus only can they furnish a sufficient nucleus for the formation of a new body nor can there be any hope of such body being adequate to its appropriate service and of its possessing that portion of good opinion which shall entitle it to the respect of its antagonists unless it live and act for a length of time under a distinct conception of the kind and degree of hostility to the executive government which is fairly warrantable <\s>
<s> the party must cease indiscriminately to court the discontented and to league itself with men who are athirst for innovation to a point which leaves it doubtful whether an opposition that is willing to co operate with such agitators loves as it ought to do and becomingly venerates the happy and glorious constitution in church and state which we have inherited from our ancestors <\s>
<s> till not a doubt can be left that this indispensible change has been effected freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> you will remain but to exhort is not my present business i was retracing the history of the influence of one family and have shewn that much of it depends upon that steady support given by them to government during a long and arduous struggle and upon the general course of their public conduct which has secured your approbation and won for them your confidence <\s>
<s> let us now candidly ask what practical evil has arisen from this preponderance <\s>
<s> is it not obvious that it is justified by the causes that have produced it <\s>
<s> as far as it concerns the general well being of the kingdom it would be easy to shew that if the democratic activities of the great towns and of the manufacturing districts were not counteracted by the sedentary power of large estates continued from generation to generation in particular families it would be scarcely possible that the laws and constitution of the country could sustain the shocks which they would be subject to <\s>
<s> and as to our own county that man must be strangely prejudiced who does not perceive how desireable it is that some powerful individual should he attached to it who by his influence with government may facilitate the execution of any plan tending with due concern for general welfare to the especial benefit of westmoreland <\s>
<s> the influence of the house of lowther is we acknowledge great but has a case been made out that this influence has been abused <\s>
<s> the voice of gratitude is not loud out of delicacy to the benefactor but if all who know were at liberty to speak to the measure of their wishes the services which have been rendered by the house of lowther to westmoreland its natives and inhabitants would be proclaimed in a manner that would confound detraction yet the kendal committee of the 26th of january without troubling themselves to inquire how far this preponderance is a reasonable thing and what have been its real and practical effects are indignant their blood is roused and they are determined to address their brother freeholders and call upon them to recover the exercise of the elective franchise which has been withheld from them for half a century withheld from them <\s>
<s> suppose these champions in this their first declaration of hostility had said to recover the elective franchise which we have suffered to lie dormant <\s>
<s> but no who would take blame to himself when by so doing he is likely to break the force of the indignation which whether deserved or not he hopes to heap upon his adversary <\s>
<s> this is politic but does it become professing men <\s>
<s> does it suit those who set forward with a proclamation that they are select spirits free from party ties and of course superior to those artifices and misrepresentations to those groundless or immoderate aversions which men who act in parties find it so difficult to keep clear of <\s>
<s> what degree of discernment and consistency an assembly of persons who begin their labours with such professions and publish such intentions have shewn by making choice of the individual whom they have recommended as eminently entitled to their confidence and qualified to assist them in attaining their end may become the fit subject of a future enquiry <\s>
<s> so these states have been called <\s>
<s> they are weaknesses a true though ill sounding title and not powers <\s>
<s> polybius tells us that hannibal entered into italy with twenty thousand men and that the aggregate forces of italy at that time amounted to seven hundred and sixty thousand foot and horse with the roman discipline and power to head that mighty force <\s>
<s> gustavus adolphus invaded germany with thirteen thousand men the emperor at that time having between two and three hundred thousand warlike and experienced troops commanded by able generals to oppose to him <\s>
<s> let these facts and numerous others which history supplies of the same kind be thought of and let us hear no more of the impossibility of great britain girt round and defended by the sea and an invincible navy becoming a military power great britain whose troops surpass in valour those of all the world and who has an army and a militia of upwards of three hundred thousand men <\s>
<s> do reflect my dear sir upon the materials which are now in preparation upon the continent <\s>
<s> hannibal expected to be joined by a parcel of the contented barbarian gauls in the north of italy <\s>
<s> gustavus stood forth as the champion of the protestant interest how feeble and limited each of these auxiliary sentiments and powers compared with what the state of knowledge the oppressions of their domestic governments and the insults and injuries and hostile cruelties inflicted by the french upon the continental nations must have exerted to second our arms whenever we shall appear in that force which we can assume and with that boldness which would become us and which justice and human nature and patriotism call upon us to put forth <\s>

<s> two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> on the occasion of these two addresses and other related matters see preface in the present volume <\s>
<s> two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> kendal printed by airey and bellingham <\s>
<s> the author thinks it proper to advise his reader that he alone is responsible for the sentiments and opinions expressed in these sheets <\s>
<s> gladly would he have availed himself of the judgment of others if that benefit could have been had without subjecting the persons consulted to the possibility of blame for having sanctioned any view of the topics under consideration which either from its erroneousness might deserve or from party feelings or other causes might incur censure <\s>
<s> the matter comprised in these pages was intended to compose a succession of addresses to be printed in the kendal chronicle and a part of the first was published through that channel <\s>
<s> the intention was dropped for reasons well known <\s>
<s> it is now mentioned in order to account for the disproportion in the length of the two addresses and an arrangement of matter in some places different from what would otherwise have been chosen <\s>
<s> a portion also has appeared in the carlisle patriot <\s>
<s> it is of little importance to add that this publication has been delayed by unavoidable engagements of the printer <\s>
<s> the new candidate has appeared amongst us and concluded for the present his labours in the county <\s>
<s> they require no further notice here than an expression of thanks for the success with which he has co operated with the author of these pages to demonstrate by the whole of his itinerant proceedings that the vital principle of the opposition ostensibly headed by him is at enmity with the bonds by which society is held together and government maintained <\s>
<s> to the freeholders c <\s>
<s> gentlemen two months have elapsed since warning was given of an intention to oppose the present representatives of the county of westmoreland at the ensuing election yet till so late a period as the 26th of january no avowal of such intention appeared from any quarter entitling it to consideration <\s>
<s> for as to the body of men calling itself the london committee there is not up to this hour i believe any public evidence even of its existence except certain notices signed by two obscure individuals <\s>
<s> but in the minds of those naturally interested in the welfare of the county a ferment was excited by various devices inflammatory addresses were busily circulated men laying claim to the flattering character of reformers of abuses became active and as this stir did not die away they who foresaw its bearings and tendencies were desirous that if there were any just grounds for discontent the same should be openly declared by persons whose characters and situations in life would be a pledge for their having proceeded upon mature deliberation <\s>
<s> at length a set of resolutions have appeared from a meeting of dissatisfied freeholders holden in a town which if not the principal in point of rank is the most populous opulent and weighty in the county <\s>
<s> among those who composed this meeting the first visible authentic body which the opposition has produced are to be found persons answering to the description above given men from whom might have been expected in the exposition of their complaints sound sense as to the nature of the grievances and rational views as to the mode of removing them have such expectations if entertained been fulfilled <\s>
<s> the first resolution unanimously agreed upon by this meeting is couched in these words it is impossible for us as freeholders to submit any longer to a single family however respectable naming both members for the county <\s>
<s> what if this leading article had been thus expressed <\s>
<s> that it is injurious to the interests and derogatory to the dignity of the county of westmoreland that both its representatives should be brought into parliament by the influence of one family <\s>
<s> words to this effect would surely have given the sense of the resolution as proceeding from men of cool reflection and offered nakedly to the consideration of minds which it was desired should be kept in a similar state <\s>
<s> but we cannot submit any longer' if the intention was to mislead and irritate such language was well adapted for the purpose but it ill accords with the spirit of the next resolution which affirms that the meeting is wholly unconnected with any political party and thus disclaiming indirectly those passions and prejudices that are apt to fasten upon political partisans implicitly promises that the opinions of the meeting shall be conveyed in terms suitable to such disavowal <\s>
<s> did the persons in question imagine themselves in a state of degradation <\s>
<s> on their own word we must believe they did and no one could object to their employing among each other such language as gave vent to feelings proceeding from that impression in a way that gratified themselves <\s>
<s> but by publishing their resolutions they shew that they are not communing for the sake of mutual sympathy but to induce others to participate a sentiment which probably they are strangers to <\s>
<s> we submit to the law and to those who are placed in authority over us while in the legitimate exercise of their functions we submit to the decrees of providence because they are not to be resisted a coward submits to be insulted a pusillanimous wretch to be despised and a knave if detected must submit to be scouted a slave submits to his taskmaster but the freeholders of westmoreland cannot in reason be said to submit to the house of lowther naming their representatives unless it can be proved that those representatives have been thrust upon them by an unjustifiable agency and that they owe their seats not to the free suffrages and frank consent of their constituents but to unfair means whether in the shape of seduction or threat <\s>
<s> if there be an indignity on one side there must have been a wrong done on the other and to make out this point it ought to have been shewn that some other person qualified by his property his education his rank and character had stood forth and offered himself to represent you freeholders of westmoreland in parliament and that in this attempt he had been crushed by the power of a single family careless of the mode in which that power was exercised <\s>
<s> i appeal to those who have had an opportunity of being acquainted with the noble lord who is at the head of that family whether they are of opinion that any consideration of his own interest or importance in the state would have induced him to oppose such a candidate provided there was reason for believing that the unabused sense of the county was with him <\s>
<s> if indeed a candidate supposed to be so favoured by the county had declared himself an enemy to the general measures of administration for some years past those measures have depended on principles of conduct of such vast importance that the noble lord must needs have endeavoured as far as prudence authorised to frustrate an attempt which in conscience he could not approve <\s>
<s> i affirm then that as there was no wrong there is no indignity the present members owe their high situation to circumstances local and national <\s>
<s> they are there because no one else has presented himself or for some years back has been likely to present himself with pretensions the reasonableness of which could enter into competition with their's <\s>
<s> this is in some points of view a misfortune but it is the fact and no class of men regret it more than the independent and judicious adherents of the house of lowther men who are happy and proud to rally round the nobleman who is the head of that house in defence of rational liberty men who know that he has proved himself a faithful guardian to the several orders of the state that he is a tried enemy to dangerous innovations a condemner of fantastic theories one who understands mankind and knows the heights and levels of human nature by which the course of the streams of social action is determined a lover of the people but one who despises as far as relates to his own practice and deplores in respect to that of others the shows and pretences and all the false arts by which the plaudits of the multitude are won and the people flattered to the common ruin of themselves and their deceivers <\s>
<s> but after all let us soberly enquire to what extent it is really an evil that two persons so nearly connected in blood should represent this county <\s>
<s> and first looking at the matter locally what is that portion of england known by the name of the county of westmoreland <\s>
<s> a county which indeed the natives of it love and are justly proud of a region famous for the production of shrewd intelligent brave active honest enterprising men but it covers no very large space on the map the soil is in general barren the country poor accordingly and of necessity thinly inhabited <\s>
<s> there are in england single towns even of a third or fourth rate importance that contain a larger population than is included within the limits of westmoreland from the foot of wrynose to the sides of stainmoor and from the banks of the kent to those of the emont <\s>
<s> is it then to be wondered at considering the antiquity of the house of lowther that circumstances should have raised it to the elevation which it holds in a district so thinly peopled neither rich in the products of agriculture nor in the materials of commerce and where it is impossible that any considerable number of country gentlemen of large or as our ancestors expressed themselves of notable estate can co exist <\s>
<s> it must unavoidably happen therefore that at all times there will be few persons in such a county furnished with the stable requisites of property rank family and personal fitness that shall point them out for such an office and dispose them to covet it by insuring that degree of public confidence which will make them independent comfortable and happy in discharging the duties which it imposes <\s>
<s> this small number will at particular periods be liable to be reduced that this has been the case is apparent upon retrospect and that the number is not large at present may be inferred from the difficulty with which a third candidate has been found and from the insignificant station which the individual who has at length obeyed the call of the discontented holds in the county <\s>
<s> with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully co operated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots <\s>
<s> looking up to the government with respectful attachment we all acknowledge that power must be controlled and checked or it will be abused hence the desirableness of a vigorous opposition in the house of commons and hence a wish grounded upon a conviction of general expediency that the opposition to ministry whose head and chief seat of action are in parliament should be efficaciously diffused through all parts of the country <\s>
<s> on this principle the two grand divisions of party under our free government are founded <\s>
<s> conscience regulated by expediency is the basis honour binding men to each other in spite of temptation is the corner stone and the superstructure is friendship protecting kindness gratitude and all the moral sentiments by which self interest is liberalized <\s>
<s> such is party looked at on the favourable side <\s>
<s> cogent moral inducements therefore exist for the prevalence of two powerful bodies in the practice of the state spreading their influence and interests throughout the country and on political considerations it is desirable that the strength of each should bear such proportion to that of the other that while ministry are able to carry into effect measures not palpably injurious the vigilance of opposition may turn to account being backed by power at all times sufficient to awe but never were that possible except when supported by manifest reason to intimidate <\s>
<s> such apportioning of the strength of the two parties has existed such a degree of power the opposition formerly possessed and if they have lost that salutary power if they are dwindled and divided they must ascribe it to their own errors <\s>
<s> they are weak because they have been unwise they are brought low because when they had solid and high ground to stand upon they took a flight into the air <\s>
<s> to have hoped too ardently of human nature as they did at the commencement of the french revolution was no dishonour to them as men but politicians cannot be allowed to plead temptations of fancy or impulses of feeling in exculpation of mistakes in judgement <\s>
<s> grant however to the enthusiasm of philanthropy as much indulgence as it may call for it is still extraordinary that in the minds of english statesmen and legislators the naked absurdity of the means did not raise a doubt as to the attainableness of the end <\s>

<s> among those who composed this meeting the first visible authentic body which the opposition has produced are to be found persons answering to the description above given men from whom might have been expected in the exposition of their complaints sound sense as to the nature of the grievances and rational views as to the mode of removing them have such expectations if entertained been fulfilled <\s>
<s> the first resolution unanimously agreed upon by this meeting is couched in these words it is impossible for us as freeholders to submit any longer to a single family however respectable naming both members for the county <\s>
<s> what if this leading article had been thus expressed <\s>
<s> that it is injurious to the interests and derogatory to the dignity of the county of westmoreland that both its representatives should be brought into parliament by the influence of one family <\s>
<s> words to this effect would surely have given the sense of the resolution as proceeding from men of cool reflection and offered nakedly to the consideration of minds which it was desired should be kept in a similar state <\s>
<s> but we cannot submit any longer' if the intention was to mislead and irritate such language was well adapted for the purpose but it ill accords with the spirit of the next resolution which affirms that the meeting is wholly unconnected with any political party and thus disclaiming indirectly those passions and prejudices that are apt to fasten upon political partisans implicitly promises that the opinions of the meeting shall be conveyed in terms suitable to such disavowal <\s>
<s> did the persons in question imagine themselves in a state of degradation <\s>
<s> on their own word we must believe they did and no one could object to their employing among each other such language as gave vent to feelings proceeding from that impression in a way that gratified themselves <\s>
<s> but by publishing their resolutions they shew that they are not communing for the sake of mutual sympathy but to induce others to participate a sentiment which probably they are strangers to <\s>
<s> we submit to the law and to those who are placed in authority over us while in the legitimate exercise of their functions we submit to the decrees of providence because they are not to be resisted a coward submits to be insulted a pusillanimous wretch to be despised and a knave if detected must submit to be scouted a slave submits to his taskmaster but the freeholders of westmoreland cannot in reason be said to submit to the house of lowther naming their representatives unless it can be proved that those representatives have been thrust upon them by an unjustifiable agency and that they owe their seats not to the free suffrages and frank consent of their constituents but to unfair means whether in the shape of seduction or threat <\s>
<s> if there be an indignity on one side there must have been a wrong done on the other and to make out this point it ought to have been shewn that some other person qualified by his property his education his rank and character had stood forth and offered himself to represent you freeholders of westmoreland in parliament and that in this attempt he had been crushed by the power of a single family careless of the mode in which that power was exercised <\s>
<s> i appeal to those who have had an opportunity of being acquainted with the noble lord who is at the head of that family whether they are of opinion that any consideration of his own interest or importance in the state would have induced him to oppose such a candidate provided there was reason for believing that the unabused sense of the county was with him <\s>
<s> if indeed a candidate supposed to be so favoured by the county had declared himself an enemy to the general measures of administration for some years past those measures have depended on principles of conduct of such vast importance that the noble lord must needs have endeavoured as far as prudence authorised to frustrate an attempt which in conscience he could not approve <\s>
<s> i affirm then that as there was no wrong there is no indignity the present members owe their high situation to circumstances local and national <\s>
<s> they are there because no one else has presented himself or for some years back has been likely to present himself with pretensions the reasonableness of which could enter into competition with their's <\s>
<s> this is in some points of view a misfortune but it is the fact and no class of men regret it more than the independent and judicious adherents of the house of lowther men who are happy and proud to rally round the nobleman who is the head of that house in defence of rational liberty men who know that he has proved himself a faithful guardian to the several orders of the state that he is a tried enemy to dangerous innovations a condemner of fantastic theories one who understands mankind and knows the heights and levels of human nature by which the course of the streams of social action is determined a lover of the people but one who despises as far as relates to his own practice and deplores in respect to that of others the shows and pretences and all the false arts by which the plaudits of the multitude are won and the people flattered to the common ruin of themselves and their deceivers <\s>
<s> but after all let us soberly enquire to what extent it is really an evil that two persons so nearly connected in blood should represent this county <\s>
<s> and first looking at the matter locally what is that portion of england known by the name of the county of westmoreland <\s>
<s> a county which indeed the natives of it love and are justly proud of a region famous for the production of shrewd intelligent brave active honest enterprising men but it covers no very large space on the map the soil is in general barren the country poor accordingly and of necessity thinly inhabited <\s>
<s> there are in england single towns even of a third or fourth rate importance that contain a larger population than is included within the limits of westmoreland from the foot of wrynose to the sides of stainmoor and from the banks of the kent to those of the emont <\s>
<s> is it then to be wondered at considering the antiquity of the house of lowther that circumstances should have raised it to the elevation which it holds in a district so thinly peopled neither rich in the products of agriculture nor in the materials of commerce and where it is impossible that any considerable number of country gentlemen of large or as our ancestors expressed themselves of notable estate can co exist <\s>
<s> it must unavoidably happen therefore that at all times there will be few persons in such a county furnished with the stable requisites of property rank family and personal fitness that shall point them out for such an office and dispose them to covet it by insuring that degree of public confidence which will make them independent comfortable and happy in discharging the duties which it imposes <\s>
<s> this small number will at particular periods be liable to be reduced that this has been the case is apparent upon retrospect and that the number is not large at present may be inferred from the difficulty with which a third candidate has been found and from the insignificant station which the individual who has at length obeyed the call of the discontented holds in the county <\s>
<s> with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully co operated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots <\s>
<s> looking up to the government with respectful attachment we all acknowledge that power must be controlled and checked or it will be abused hence the desirableness of a vigorous opposition in the house of commons and hence a wish grounded upon a conviction of general expediency that the opposition to ministry whose head and chief seat of action are in parliament should be efficaciously diffused through all parts of the country <\s>
<s> on this principle the two grand divisions of party under our free government are founded <\s>
<s> conscience regulated by expediency is the basis honour binding men to each other in spite of temptation is the corner stone and the superstructure is friendship protecting kindness gratitude and all the moral sentiments by which self interest is liberalized <\s>
<s> such is party looked at on the favourable side <\s>
<s> cogent moral inducements therefore exist for the prevalence of two powerful bodies in the practice of the state spreading their influence and interests throughout the country and on political considerations it is desirable that the strength of each should bear such proportion to that of the other that while ministry are able to carry into effect measures not palpably injurious the vigilance of opposition may turn to account being backed by power at all times sufficient to awe but never were that possible except when supported by manifest reason to intimidate <\s>
<s> such apportioning of the strength of the two parties has existed such a degree of power the opposition formerly possessed and if they have lost that salutary power if they are dwindled and divided they must ascribe it to their own errors <\s>
<s> they are weak because they have been unwise they are brought low because when they had solid and high ground to stand upon they took a flight into the air <\s>
<s> to have hoped too ardently of human nature as they did at the commencement of the french revolution was no dishonour to them as men but politicians cannot be allowed to plead temptations of fancy or impulses of feeling in exculpation of mistakes in judgement <\s>
<s> grant however to the enthusiasm of philanthropy as much indulgence as it may call for it is still extraordinary that in the minds of english statesmen and legislators the naked absurdity of the means did not raise a doubt as to the attainableness of the end <\s>
<s> fox captivated by the vanities of a system founded upon abstract rights chaunted his expectations in the house of parliament and too many of his friends partook of the illusion <\s>
<s> the most sagacious politician of his age broke out in an opposite strain <\s>
<s> time has verified his predictions the books remain in which his principles of foreknowledge were laid down but as the author became afterwards a pensioner of state thousands in this country of free opinions persist in asserting that his divination was guess work and that conscience had no part in urging him to speak <\s>
<s> that warning voice proved vain the party from whom he separated proceeded confiding in splendid oratorical talents and ardent feelings rashly wedded to novel expectations when common sense uninquisitive experience and a modest reliance on old habits of judgement when either these or a philosophic penetration were the only qualities that could have served them <\s>
<s> how many private individuals at that period were kept in a rational course by circumstances supplying restraints which their own understandings would not have furnished <\s>
<s> through what fatality it happens that bodies of men are so slow to profit in a similar way by circumstances affecting their prosperity the opposition seem never to have enquired <\s>
<s> they could not avoid observing that the holders of property throughout the country being mostly panic stricken by the proceedings in france turned instinctively against the admirers of the new system and as security for property is the very basis of civil society how was it possible but that reflecting men who perceived this truth should mistrust those representatives of the people who could not have acted less prudently had they been utterly unconscious of it <\s>
<s> but they had committed themselves and did not retract either from unabating devotion to their cause or from false honour and that self injuring consistency the favourite sister of obstinacy which the mixed conscience of mankind is but too apt to produce <\s>
<s> meanwhile the tactics of parliament must continue in exercise on some system or other their adversaries were to be annoyed at any rate and so intent were they upon this that in proportion as the entrenchments of ministry strengthened the assaults of opposition became more careless and desperate <\s>
<s> while the war of words and opinions was going forward in this country europe was deluged with blood <\s>
<s> they in whose hands power was vested among us in course of time lost ground in public opinion through the failure of their efforts <\s>
<s> parties were broken and re composed but men who are brought together less by principle than by events cannot cordially co operate or remain long united <\s>
<s> the opponents of the war in this middle stage and desponding state of it were not popular and afterwards when the success of the enemy made the majority of the nation feel that peace dictated by him could not be lasting and they were bent on persevering in the struggle the party of opposition persisted in a course of action which as their countenance of the doctrine of the rights of man had brought their understandings into disrepute cast suspicion on the soundness of their patriotic affections <\s>
<s> their passions made them blind to the differences between a state of peace and war above all such a war as prescribing rules for their own conduct <\s>
<s> they were ignorant or never bore in mind that a species of hostility which had there been no foreign enemy to resist might have proved useful and honourable became equally pernicious and disgraceful when a formidable foe threatened us with destruction <\s>
<s> i appeal to impartial recollection whether during the course of the late awful struggle and in the latter stages of it especially the antagonists of ministers in the two houses of parliament did not for the most part conduct themselves more like allies to a military despot who was attempting to enslave the world and to whom their own country was an object of paramount hatred than like honest englishmen who had breathed the air of liberty from their cradles <\s>
<s> if any state of things could supply them with motives for acting in that manner they must abide by the consequences <\s>
<s> they must reconcile themselves as well as they can to dislike and to disesteem the unavoidable results of behaviour so unnatural <\s>
<s> peace has indeed come but do they who deprecated the continuance of the war and clamoured for its close on any terms rejoice heartily in a triumph by which their prophecies were belied <\s>
<s> did they lend their voices to swell the hymn of transport that resounded through our land when the arch enemy was overthrown <\s>
<s> are they pleased that inheritances have been restored and that legitimate governments have been re established on the continent <\s>
<s> and do they grieve when those re established governments act unworthily of the favour which providence has shown them <\s>
<s> do not too many rather secretly congratulate themselves on every proof of imbecility or misconduct there exhibited and endeavour that attention shall be exclusively fixed on those melancholy facts as if they were the only fruits of a triumph to which we britons owe that we are a fearless undishonoured and rapidly improving people and the nations of the continent owe their very existence as self governed communities <\s>
<s> the party of opposition or what remains of it has much to repent of many humiliating reflections must pass through the minds of those who compose it and they must learn the hard lesson to be thankful for them as a discipline indispensible to their amendment <\s>
<s> thus only can they furnish a sufficient nucleus for the formation of a new body nor can there be any hope of such body being adequate to its appropriate service and of its possessing that portion of good opinion which shall entitle it to the respect of its antagonists unless it live and act for a length of time under a distinct conception of the kind and degree of hostility to the executive government which is fairly warrantable <\s>
<s> the party must cease indiscriminately to court the discontented and to league itself with men who are athirst for innovation to a point which leaves it doubtful whether an opposition that is willing to co operate with such agitators loves as it ought to do and becomingly venerates the happy and glorious constitution in church and state which we have inherited from our ancestors <\s>
<s> till not a doubt can be left that this indispensible change has been effected freeholders of westmoreland <\s>
<s> you will remain but to exhort is not my present business i was retracing the history of the influence of one family and have shewn that much of it depends upon that steady support given by them to government during a long and arduous struggle and upon the general course of their public conduct which has secured your approbation and won for them your confidence <\s>
<s> let us now candidly ask what practical evil has arisen from this preponderance <\s>
<s> is it not obvious that it is justified by the causes that have produced it <\s>
<s> as far as it concerns the general well being of the kingdom it would be easy to shew that if the democratic activities of the great towns and of the manufacturing districts were not counteracted by the sedentary power of large estates continued from generation to generation in particular families it would be scarcely possible that the laws and constitution of the country could sustain the shocks which they would be subject to <\s>
<s> and as to our own county that man must be strangely prejudiced who does not perceive how desireable it is that some powerful individual should he attached to it who by his influence with government may facilitate the execution of any plan tending with due concern for general welfare to the especial benefit of westmoreland <\s>
<s> the influence of the house of lowther is we acknowledge great but has a case been made out that this influence has been abused <\s>
<s> the voice of gratitude is not loud out of delicacy to the benefactor but if all who know were at liberty to speak to the measure of their wishes the services which have been rendered by the house of lowther to westmoreland its natives and inhabitants would be proclaimed in a manner that would confound detraction yet the kendal committee of the 26th of january without troubling themselves to inquire how far this preponderance is a reasonable thing and what have been its real and practical effects are indignant their blood is roused and they are determined to address their brother freeholders and call upon them to recover the exercise of the elective franchise which has been withheld from them for half a century withheld from them <\s>
<s> suppose these champions in this their first declaration of hostility had said to recover the elective franchise which we have suffered to lie dormant <\s>
<s> but no who would take blame to himself when by so doing he is likely to break the force of the indignation which whether deserved or not he hopes to heap upon his adversary <\s>
<s> this is politic but does it become professing men <\s>
<s> does it suit those who set forward with a proclamation that they are select spirits free from party ties and of course superior to those artifices and misrepresentations to those groundless or immoderate aversions which men who act in parties find it so difficult to keep clear of <\s>
<s> what degree of discernment and consistency an assembly of persons who begin their labours with such professions and publish such intentions have shewn by making choice of the individual whom they have recommended as eminently entitled to their confidence and qualified to assist them in attaining their end may become the fit subject of a future enquiry <\s>
