<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>

<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>

<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>

<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>

<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>

<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> how long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours unnerve thy vigour and enchain thy powers <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>

<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>

<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>

<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>

<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>
<s> ye winds that have made me your sport convey to this desolate shore some cordial endearing report of a land i must visit no more <\s>
<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>

<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>

<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>

<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>

<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>

<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>

<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>

<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>

<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>

<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>
<s> johnson turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes observe her labours sluggard and be wise no stern command no monitory voice prescribes her duties or directs her choice yet timely provident she hastes away to snatch the blessings of a plenteous day when fruitful summer loads the teeming plain she crops the harvest and she stores the grain <\s>
<s> how long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours unnerve thy vigour and enchain thy powers <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>

<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>

<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>

<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>

<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>

<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>

<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>

<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>

<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>
<s> johnson turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes observe her labours sluggard and be wise no stern command no monitory voice prescribes her duties or directs her choice yet timely provident she hastes away to snatch the blessings of a plenteous day when fruitful summer loads the teeming plain she crops the harvest and she stores the grain <\s>
<s> how long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours unnerve thy vigour and enchain thy powers <\s>
<s> while artful shades thy downy couch enclose and soft solicitation courts repose amidst the drowsy charms of dull delight year chases year with unremitted flight till want now following fraudulent and slow shall spring to seize thee like an ambush'd foe <\s>

<s> one more quotation and i have done <\s>
<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>
<s> ye winds that have made me your sport convey to this desolate shore some cordial endearing report of a land i must visit no more <\s>
<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>
<s> johnson turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes observe her labours sluggard and be wise no stern command no monitory voice prescribes her duties or directs her choice yet timely provident she hastes away to snatch the blessings of a plenteous day when fruitful summer loads the teeming plain she crops the harvest and she stores the grain <\s>

<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>

<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>

<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>

<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>

<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>

<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> how long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours unnerve thy vigour and enchain thy powers <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>

<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>

<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>

<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>

<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>
<s> ye winds that have made me your sport convey to this desolate shore some cordial endearing report of a land i must visit no more <\s>
<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>

<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>

<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>

<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>

<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>

<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>

<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>

<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>

<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>

<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>
<s> johnson turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes observe her labours sluggard and be wise no stern command no monitory voice prescribes her duties or directs her choice yet timely provident she hastes away to snatch the blessings of a plenteous day when fruitful summer loads the teeming plain she crops the harvest and she stores the grain <\s>
<s> how long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours unnerve thy vigour and enchain thy powers <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>

<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>

<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>

<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>

<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>

<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>

<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>

<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>

<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>
<s> johnson turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes observe her labours sluggard and be wise no stern command no monitory voice prescribes her duties or directs her choice yet timely provident she hastes away to snatch the blessings of a plenteous day when fruitful summer loads the teeming plain she crops the harvest and she stores the grain <\s>
<s> how long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours unnerve thy vigour and enchain thy powers <\s>
<s> while artful shades thy downy couch enclose and soft solicitation courts repose amidst the drowsy charms of dull delight year chases year with unremitted flight till want now following fraudulent and slow shall spring to seize thee like an ambush'd foe <\s>

<s> one more quotation and i have done <\s>
<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>
<s> ye winds that have made me your sport convey to this desolate shore some cordial endearing report of a land i must visit no more <\s>
<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>
<s> johnson turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes observe her labours sluggard and be wise no stern command no monitory voice prescribes her duties or directs her choice yet timely provident she hastes away to snatch the blessings of a plenteous day when fruitful summer loads the teeming plain she crops the harvest and she stores the grain <\s>

<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>

<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>

<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>

<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>

<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>

<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> how long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours unnerve thy vigour and enchain thy powers <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>

<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>

<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>

<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>

<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>
<s> ye winds that have made me your sport convey to this desolate shore some cordial endearing report of a land i must visit no more <\s>
<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>

<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>

<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>

<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>

<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>

<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>

<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>

<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>

<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>

<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>
<s> johnson turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes observe her labours sluggard and be wise no stern command no monitory voice prescribes her duties or directs her choice yet timely provident she hastes away to snatch the blessings of a plenteous day when fruitful summer loads the teeming plain she crops the harvest and she stores the grain <\s>
<s> how long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours unnerve thy vigour and enchain thy powers <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>

<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>

<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>

<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>

<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>

<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>

<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>

<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>

<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>

<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>
<s> johnson turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes observe her labours sluggard and be wise no stern command no monitory voice prescribes her duties or directs her choice yet timely provident she hastes away to snatch the blessings of a plenteous day when fruitful summer loads the teeming plain she crops the harvest and she stores the grain <\s>
<s> how long shall sloth usurp thy useless hours unnerve thy vigour and enchain thy powers <\s>
<s> while artful shades thy downy couch enclose and soft solicitation courts repose amidst the drowsy charms of dull delight year chases year with unremitted flight till want now following fraudulent and slow shall spring to seize thee like an ambush'd foe <\s>

<s> one more quotation and i have done <\s>
<s> it is from cowper's verses supposed to be written by alexander selkirk religion <\s>
<s> what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word <\s>
<s> more precious than silver and gold or all that this earth can afford <\s>
<s> but the sound of the church going bell these valleys and rocks never heard ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell or smiled when a sabbath appeared <\s>
<s> ye winds that have made me your sport convey to this desolate shore some cordial endearing report of a land i must visit no more <\s>
<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>
<s> see pope's messiah throughout prior's did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels etc etc <\s>
<s> by way of immediate example take the following of dr <\s>
<s> johnson turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes observe her labours sluggard and be wise no stern command no monitory voice prescribes her duties or directs her choice yet timely provident she hastes away to snatch the blessings of a plenteous day when fruitful summer loads the teeming plain she crops the harvest and she stores the grain <\s>

<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>

<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
<s> a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation <\s>
<s> the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other <\s>
<s> the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes <\s>
<s> besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority <\s>
<s> thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him <\s>
<s> to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded <\s>
<s> this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life <\s>
<s> this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual <\s>
<s> but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men <\s>
<s> this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves <\s>
<s> in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so <\s>
<s> abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas <\s>
<s> it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction <\s>
<s> it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poet's character and in flattering the reader's self love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow <\s>
<s> the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern <\s>
<s> perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation <\s>

<s> my friends do they now and then send a wish or a thought after me <\s>
<s> o tell me i yet have a friend though a friend i am never to see <\s>
<s> this passage is quoted as an instance of three different styles of composition <\s>
<s> the first four lines are poorly expressed some critics would call the language prosaic the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre <\s>
<s> the epithet church going applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration <\s>
<s> the two lines ne'er sigh'd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction <\s>
<s> the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre <\s>
<s> the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have said namely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language <\s>
<s> metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious <\s>
<s> c poetry as a study <\s>
<s> with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itself the thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business <\s>
<s> poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement <\s>
<s> in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life <\s>
<s> and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study <\s>
<s> into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work <\s>
<s> the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry <\s>
<s> the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force <\s>
<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>

<s> the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions <\s>
<s> what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced <\s>
<s> what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reason when a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or common sense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughts is ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity <\s>
<s> but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures <\s>
<s> the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season <\s>
<s> but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life <\s>
<s> moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous <\s>
<s> the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment <\s>
<s> if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the cause that having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth <\s>
<s> if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life <\s>
<s> as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored <\s>
<s> the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties <\s>
<s> having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt <\s>
<s> if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style <\s>
<s> in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination <\s>
<s> wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments <\s>
<s> but it is a well known property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness <\s>
<s> is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony <\s>
<s> it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve i e <\s>
<s> obey with zeal and fidelity two masters <\s>
<s> as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable <\s>
<s> but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice <\s>
<s> besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves <\s>
<s> attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to over rate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced <\s>
<s> they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poet's language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it <\s>
<s> and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment <\s>
<s> love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his book to these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal <\s>
<s> for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions <\s>
<s> accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspicious and at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself <\s>
<s> faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity the elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness <\s>
<s> the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing <\s>
<s> the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols <\s>
<s> the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity <\s>
<s> in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religion making up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetry passionate for the instruction of reason between religion whose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetry ethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation <\s>
<s> in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout <\s>
<s> whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value <\s>
<s> for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government <\s>
<s> where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb <\s>
<s> for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of it among those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings <\s>
<s> at the same time it must be observed that as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse <\s>
<s> for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold <\s>
<s> in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order <\s>
<s> in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompany confounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the region men of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocatives judges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous <\s>
<s> in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst <\s>
<s> the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience <\s>
<s> if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their merits must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes a vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer <\s>
<s> let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences <\s>
<s> who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas <\s>
<s> yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it <\s>
