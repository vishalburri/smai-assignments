<s> the river duddon a series of sonnets <\s>
<s> the river duddon rises upon wrynose fell on the confines of westmoreland cumberland and lancashire and having served as a boundary to the two last counties for the space of about twenty five miles enters the irish sea between the isle of walney and the lordship of millum <\s>
<s> a poet whose works are not yet known as they deserve to be thus enters upon his description of the ruins of rome the rising sun flames on the ruins in the purer air towering aloft and ends thus the setting sun displays his visible great round between yon towers as through two shady cliffs <\s>
<s> crowe in his excellent loco descriptive poem lewesdon hill is still more expeditious finishing the whole on a may morning before breakfast <\s>
<s> tomorrow for severer thought but now to breakfast and keep festival to day <\s>
<s> no one believes or is desired to believe that those poems were actually composed within such limits of time nor was there any reason why a prose statement should acquaint the reader with the plain fact to the disturbance of poetic credibility <\s>
<s> but in the present case i am compelled to mention that the above series of sonnets was the growth of many years the one which stands the 14th was the first produced and others were added upon occasional visits to the stream or as recollections of the scenes upon its banks awakened a wish to describe them <\s>
<s> in this manner i had proceeded insensibly without perceiving that i was trespassing upon ground pre occupied at least as far as intention went by mr <\s>
<s> coleridge who more than twenty years ago used to speak of writing a rural poem to be entitled the brook of which he has given a sketch in a recent publication <\s>
<s> but a particular subject cannot i think much interfere with a general one and i have been further kept from encroaching upon any right mr <\s>
<s> may still wish to exercise by the restriction which the frame of the sonnet imposed upon me narrowing unavoidably the range of thought and precluding though not without its advantages many graces to which a freer movement of verse would naturally have led <\s>
<s> may i not venture then to hope that instead of being a hindrance by anticipation of any part of the subject these sonnets may remind mr <\s>
<s> coleridge of his own more comprehensive design and induce him to fulfil it there is a sympathy in streams one calleth to another and i would gladly believe that the brook will ere long murmur in concert with the duddon <\s>
<s> but asking pardon for this fancy i need not scruple to say that those verses must indeed be ill fated which can enter upon such pleasant walks of nature without receiving and giving inspiration <\s>
<s> the power of waters over the minds of poets has been acknowledged from the earliest ages through the flumina amem sylvasque inglorius of virgil down to the sublime apostrophe to the great rivers of the earth by armstrong and the simple ejaculation of burns chosen if i recollect right by mr <\s>
<s> coleridge as a motto for his embryo brook the muse nae poet ever fand her till by himsel he learned to wander adown some trotting burn's meander and na think lang <\s>
<s> the sonnets on the river duddon <\s>
<s> it is with the little river duddon as it is with most other rivers ganges and nile not excepted many springs might claim the honour of being its head <\s>
<s> in my own fancy i have fixed its rise near the noted shire stones placed at the meeting point of the counties westmoreland cumberland and lancashire <\s>
<s> they stand by the wayside on the top of the wrynose pass and it used to be reckoned a proud thing to say that by touching them at the same time with feet and hands one had been in three counties at once <\s>
<s> at what point of its course the stream takes the name of duddon i do not know <\s>
<s> i first became acquainted with the duddon as i have good reason to remember in early boyhood <\s>
<s> upon the banks of the derwent i had learnt to be very fond of angling <\s>
<s> fish abound in that large river not so in the small streams in the neighbourhood of hawkshead and i fell into the common delusion that the farther from home the better sport would be had <\s>
<s> accordingly one day i attached myself to a person living in the neighbourhood of hawkshead who was going to try his fortune as an angler near the source of the duddon <\s>
<s> we fished a great part of the day with very sorry success the rain pouring torrents and long before we got home i was worn out with fatigue and if the good man had not carried me on his back i must have lain down under the best shelter i could find <\s>
<s> little did i think then it would have been my lot to celebrate in a strain of love and admiration the stream which for many years i never thought of without recollections of disappointment and distress <\s>
<s> during my college vacation and two or three years afterwards before taking my bachelor's degree i was several times resident in the house of a near relative who lived in the small town of broughton <\s>
<s> i passed many delightful hours upon the banks of this river which becomes an estuary about a mile from that place <\s>
<s> the remembrances of that period are the subject of the 21st sonnet <\s>
<s> the subject of the 27th sonnet is in fact taken from a tradition belonging to rydal hall which once stood as is believed upon a rocky and woody hill on the right hand as you go from rydal to ambleside and was deserted from the superstitious fear here described and the present site fortunately chosen instead <\s>
<s> the present hall was erected by sir michael le fleming and it may be hoped that at some future time there will be an edifice more worthy of so beautiful a position <\s>
<s> with regard to the 30th sonnet it is odd enough that this imagination was realised in the year 1840 when i made a tour through this district with my wife and daughter miss fenwick and her niece and mr <\s>
<s> before our return from seathwaite chapel the party separated <\s>
<s> wordsworth while most of us went further up the stream chose an opposite direction having told us that we would overtake her on our way to ulpha <\s>
<s> but she was tempted out of the main road to ascend a rocky eminence near it thinking it impossible we should pass without seeing her <\s>
<s> this however unfortunately happened and then ensued vexation and distress especially to me which i should be ashamed to have recorded for i lost my temper entirely <\s>
<s> neither i nor those who were with me saw her again till we reached the inn at broughton seven miles <\s>
<s> this may perhaps in some degree excuse my irritability on the occasion for i could not but think she had been much to blame <\s>
<s> it appeared however on explanation that she had remained on the rock calling out and waving her handkerchief as we were passing in order that we also might ascend and enjoy a prospect which had much charmed her <\s>
<s> but on we went her signals proving vain <\s>
<s> how then could she reach broughton before us <\s>
<s> when we found she had not gone on to ulpha kirk mr <\s>
<s> quillinan went back in one of the carriages in search of her <\s>
<s> he met her on the road took her up and by a shorter way conveyed her to broughton where we were all re united and spent a happy evening <\s>
<s> i have many affecting remembrances connected with this stream <\s>
<s> these i forbear to mention especially things that occurred on its banks during the latter part of that visit to the sea side of which the former part is detailed in my epistle to sir george beaumont <\s>
<s> the following additional notices of his latter excursion to the banks of the duddon are from a letter to lady frederick bentinck <\s>
<s> you will have wondered dear lady frederick what is become of me <\s>
<s> i have been wandering about the country and only returned yesterday <\s>
<s> our tour was by keswick scale hill buttermere loweswater ennerdale calder abbey wastdale eskdale the vale of duddon broughton furness abbey peele castle ulverston c we had broken weather which kept us long upon the road but we had also very fine intervals and i often wished you had been present <\s>
<s> we had such glorious sights <\s>
<s> one in particular i never saw the like of <\s>
<s> about sunset we were directly opposite that large lofty precipice at wastwater which is called the screes <\s>
<s> the ridge of it is broken into sundry points and along them and partly along the side of the steep went driving a procession of yellow vapoury clouds from the sea quarter towards the mountain scawfell <\s>
<s> their colours i have called yellow but it was exquisitely varied and the shapes of the rocks on the summit of the ridge varied with the density or thinness of the vapours <\s>
