<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>

<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>
<s> but to be serious <\s>
<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>

<s> i am dear sir respectfully yours william wordsworth <\s>
<s> rydal mount january 1816 <\s>
<s> 5 it was deemed that it would be so and the letter is published accordingly <\s>
<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>

<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>

<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>

<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>
<s> the question lies between spite and presumption and it is not easy to decide upon a case where the claims of each party are so strong but the name of aristarch who simple man <\s>
<s> would allow no verse to pass for homer's which he did not approve of is retained for reasons that will be deemed cogent <\s>
<s> fortunate is it for the world when this spirit incites only to actions that meet with an adequate punishment in derision such as in a scheme of poetical justice would be aptly requited by assigning to the agents when they quit this lower world a station in that not uncomfortable limbo the paradise of fools <\s>
<s> but assuredly we shall have here another proof that ridicule is not the test of truth if it prevent us from perceiving that depravity has no ally more active more inveterate nor from the difficulty of divining to what kind and degree of extravagance it may prompt more pernicious than self conceit <\s>
<s> where this alliance is too obvious to be disputed the culprit ought not to be allowed the benefit of contempt as a shelter from detestation much less should he be permitted to plead in excuse for his transgressions that especial malevolence had little or no part in them <\s>
<s> it is not recorded that the ancient who set fire to the temple of diana had a particular dislike to the goddess of chastity or held idolatry in abhorrence he was a fool an egregious fool but not the less on that account a most odious monster <\s>
<s> the tyrant who is described as having rattled his chariot along a bridge of brass over the heads of his subjects was no doubt inwardly laughed at but what if this mock jupiter not satisfied with an empty noise of his own making had amused himself with throwing fire brands upon the house tops as a substitute for lightning and from his elevation had hurled stones upon the heads of his people to show that he was a master of the destructive bolt as well as of the harmless voice of the thunder the lovers of all that is honourable to humanity have recently had occasion to rejoice over the downfall of an intoxicated despot whose vagaries furnish more solid materials by which the philosopher will exemplify how strict is the connection between the ludicrously and the terribly fantastic <\s>
<s> we know also that robespierre was one of the vainest men that the most vain country upon earth has produced and from this passion and from that cowardice which naturally connects itself with it flowed the horrors of his administration <\s>

<s> 5 it was deemed that it would be so and the letter is published accordingly <\s>
<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> rydal mount april 8 <\s>
<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>

<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>

<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>

<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>

<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>

<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>

<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>

<s> but assuredly we shall have here another proof that ridicule is not the test of truth if it prevent us from perceiving that depravity has no ally more active more inveterate nor from the difficulty of divining to what kind and degree of extravagance it may prompt more pernicious than self conceit <\s>

<s> the tyrant who is described as having rattled his chariot along a bridge of brass over the heads of his subjects was no doubt inwardly laughed at but what if this mock jupiter not satisfied with an empty noise of his own making had amused himself with throwing fire brands upon the house tops as a substitute for lightning and from his elevation had hurled stones upon the heads of his people to show that he was a master of the destructive bolt as well as of the harmless voice of the thunder the lovers of all that is honourable to humanity have recently had occasion to rejoice over the downfall of an intoxicated despot whose vagaries furnish more solid materials by which the philosopher will exemplify how strict is the connection between the ludicrously and the terribly fantastic <\s>

<s> the transition from a vindication of robert burns to these hints for a picture of the intellectual deformity of one who has grossly outraged his memory is too natural to require an apology but i feel sir that i stand in need of indulgence for having detained you so long <\s>
<s> let me beg that you would impart to any judicious friends of the poet as much of the contents of these pages as you think will be serviceable to the cause but do not give publicity to any portion of them unless it be thought probable that an open circulation of the whole may be useful 5 the subject is delicate and some of the opinions are of a kind which if torn away from the trunk that supports them will be apt to wither and in that state to contract poisonous qualities like the branches of the yew which while united by a living spirit to their native tree are neither noxious nor without beauty but being dissevered and cast upon the ground become deadly to the cattle that incautiously feed upon them <\s>
<s> gilbert burns especially let my sentiments be conveyed with my sincere respects and best wishes for the success of his praise worthy enterprize <\s>
<s> and if through modest apprehension he should doubt of his own ability to do justice to his brother's memory let him take encouragement from the assurance that the most odious part of the charges owed its credit to the silence of those who were deemed best entitled to speak and who it was thought would not have been mute had they believed that they could speak beneficially <\s>
<s> moreover it may be relied on as a general truth which will not escape his recollection that tasks of this kind are not so arduous as to those who are tenderly concerned in their issue they may at first appear to be for if the many be hasty to condemn there is a re action of generosity which stimulates them when forcibly summoned to redress the wrong and for the sensible part of mankind they are neither dull to understand nor slow to make allowance for the aberrations of men whose intellectual powers do honour to their species <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>

<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>

<s> i am dear sir respectfully yours william wordsworth <\s>

<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>

<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>
<s> but to be serious <\s>
<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>
<s> the question lies between spite and presumption and it is not easy to decide upon a case where the claims of each party are so strong but the name of aristarch who simple man <\s>
<s> would allow no verse to pass for homer's which he did not approve of is retained for reasons that will be deemed cogent <\s>
<s> fortunate is it for the world when this spirit incites only to actions that meet with an adequate punishment in derision such as in a scheme of poetical justice would be aptly requited by assigning to the agents when they quit this lower world a station in that not uncomfortable limbo the paradise of fools <\s>

<s> i am dear sir respectfully yours william wordsworth <\s>
<s> rydal mount january 1816 <\s>
<s> 5 it was deemed that it would be so and the letter is published accordingly <\s>
<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>

<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>
<s> but to be serious <\s>
<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>
<s> peterkin's pamphlet who vouches for the accuracy of his citations omitting however to apologize for their length <\s>
<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>
<s> the question lies between spite and presumption and it is not easy to decide upon a case where the claims of each party are so strong but the name of aristarch who simple man <\s>
<s> would allow no verse to pass for homer's which he did not approve of is retained for reasons that will be deemed cogent <\s>
<s> fortunate is it for the world when this spirit incites only to actions that meet with an adequate punishment in derision such as in a scheme of poetical justice would be aptly requited by assigning to the agents when they quit this lower world a station in that not uncomfortable limbo the paradise of fools <\s>
<s> but assuredly we shall have here another proof that ridicule is not the test of truth if it prevent us from perceiving that depravity has no ally more active more inveterate nor from the difficulty of divining to what kind and degree of extravagance it may prompt more pernicious than self conceit <\s>
<s> where this alliance is too obvious to be disputed the culprit ought not to be allowed the benefit of contempt as a shelter from detestation much less should he be permitted to plead in excuse for his transgressions that especial malevolence had little or no part in them <\s>
<s> it is not recorded that the ancient who set fire to the temple of diana had a particular dislike to the goddess of chastity or held idolatry in abhorrence he was a fool an egregious fool but not the less on that account a most odious monster <\s>
<s> the tyrant who is described as having rattled his chariot along a bridge of brass over the heads of his subjects was no doubt inwardly laughed at but what if this mock jupiter not satisfied with an empty noise of his own making had amused himself with throwing fire brands upon the house tops as a substitute for lightning and from his elevation had hurled stones upon the heads of his people to show that he was a master of the destructive bolt as well as of the harmless voice of the thunder the lovers of all that is honourable to humanity have recently had occasion to rejoice over the downfall of an intoxicated despot whose vagaries furnish more solid materials by which the philosopher will exemplify how strict is the connection between the ludicrously and the terribly fantastic <\s>
<s> we know also that robespierre was one of the vainest men that the most vain country upon earth has produced and from this passion and from that cowardice which naturally connects itself with it flowed the horrors of his administration <\s>
<s> it is a descent which i fear you will scarcely pardon to compare these redoubtable enemies of mankind with the anonymous conductor of a perishable publication <\s>
<s> but the moving spirit is the same in them all and as far as difference of circumstances and disparity of powers will allow manifests itself in the same way by professions of reverence for truth and concern for duty carried to the giddiest heights of ostentation while practice seems to have no other reliance than on the omnipotence of falsehood <\s>
<s> the transition from a vindication of robert burns to these hints for a picture of the intellectual deformity of one who has grossly outraged his memory is too natural to require an apology but i feel sir that i stand in need of indulgence for having detained you so long <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>

<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>

<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>
<s> but to be serious <\s>
<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> i am dear sir respectfully yours william wordsworth <\s>

<s> 5 it was deemed that it would be so and the letter is published accordingly <\s>
<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>

<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>

<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>
<s> but to be serious <\s>
<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>
<s> the question lies between spite and presumption and it is not easy to decide upon a case where the claims of each party are so strong but the name of aristarch who simple man <\s>
<s> would allow no verse to pass for homer's which he did not approve of is retained for reasons that will be deemed cogent <\s>
<s> fortunate is it for the world when this spirit incites only to actions that meet with an adequate punishment in derision such as in a scheme of poetical justice would be aptly requited by assigning to the agents when they quit this lower world a station in that not uncomfortable limbo the paradise of fools <\s>
<s> but assuredly we shall have here another proof that ridicule is not the test of truth if it prevent us from perceiving that depravity has no ally more active more inveterate nor from the difficulty of divining to what kind and degree of extravagance it may prompt more pernicious than self conceit <\s>
<s> where this alliance is too obvious to be disputed the culprit ought not to be allowed the benefit of contempt as a shelter from detestation much less should he be permitted to plead in excuse for his transgressions that especial malevolence had little or no part in them <\s>

<s> i am dear sir respectfully yours william wordsworth <\s>
<s> rydal mount january 1816 <\s>
<s> 5 it was deemed that it would be so and the letter is published accordingly <\s>
<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>

<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>
<s> but to be serious <\s>
<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>
<s> peterkin's pamphlet who vouches for the accuracy of his citations omitting however to apologize for their length <\s>
<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>
<s> the question lies between spite and presumption and it is not easy to decide upon a case where the claims of each party are so strong but the name of aristarch who simple man <\s>
<s> would allow no verse to pass for homer's which he did not approve of is retained for reasons that will be deemed cogent <\s>
<s> fortunate is it for the world when this spirit incites only to actions that meet with an adequate punishment in derision such as in a scheme of poetical justice would be aptly requited by assigning to the agents when they quit this lower world a station in that not uncomfortable limbo the paradise of fools <\s>
<s> but assuredly we shall have here another proof that ridicule is not the test of truth if it prevent us from perceiving that depravity has no ally more active more inveterate nor from the difficulty of divining to what kind and degree of extravagance it may prompt more pernicious than self conceit <\s>
<s> where this alliance is too obvious to be disputed the culprit ought not to be allowed the benefit of contempt as a shelter from detestation much less should he be permitted to plead in excuse for his transgressions that especial malevolence had little or no part in them <\s>
<s> it is not recorded that the ancient who set fire to the temple of diana had a particular dislike to the goddess of chastity or held idolatry in abhorrence he was a fool an egregious fool but not the less on that account a most odious monster <\s>
<s> the tyrant who is described as having rattled his chariot along a bridge of brass over the heads of his subjects was no doubt inwardly laughed at but what if this mock jupiter not satisfied with an empty noise of his own making had amused himself with throwing fire brands upon the house tops as a substitute for lightning and from his elevation had hurled stones upon the heads of his people to show that he was a master of the destructive bolt as well as of the harmless voice of the thunder the lovers of all that is honourable to humanity have recently had occasion to rejoice over the downfall of an intoxicated despot whose vagaries furnish more solid materials by which the philosopher will exemplify how strict is the connection between the ludicrously and the terribly fantastic <\s>
<s> we know also that robespierre was one of the vainest men that the most vain country upon earth has produced and from this passion and from that cowardice which naturally connects itself with it flowed the horrors of his administration <\s>
<s> it is a descent which i fear you will scarcely pardon to compare these redoubtable enemies of mankind with the anonymous conductor of a perishable publication <\s>
<s> but the moving spirit is the same in them all and as far as difference of circumstances and disparity of powers will allow manifests itself in the same way by professions of reverence for truth and concern for duty carried to the giddiest heights of ostentation while practice seems to have no other reliance than on the omnipotence of falsehood <\s>
<s> the transition from a vindication of robert burns to these hints for a picture of the intellectual deformity of one who has grossly outraged his memory is too natural to require an apology but i feel sir that i stand in need of indulgence for having detained you so long <\s>
<s> let me beg that you would impart to any judicious friends of the poet as much of the contents of these pages as you think will be serviceable to the cause but do not give publicity to any portion of them unless it be thought probable that an open circulation of the whole may be useful 5 the subject is delicate and some of the opinions are of a kind which if torn away from the trunk that supports them will be apt to wither and in that state to contract poisonous qualities like the branches of the yew which while united by a living spirit to their native tree are neither noxious nor without beauty but being dissevered and cast upon the ground become deadly to the cattle that incautiously feed upon them <\s>
<s> gilbert burns especially let my sentiments be conveyed with my sincere respects and best wishes for the success of his praise worthy enterprize <\s>
<s> and if through modest apprehension he should doubt of his own ability to do justice to his brother's memory let him take encouragement from the assurance that the most odious part of the charges owed its credit to the silence of those who were deemed best entitled to speak and who it was thought would not have been mute had they believed that they could speak beneficially <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>

<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>

<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>

<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>

<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>

<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>
<s> but to be serious <\s>
<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>

<s> i am dear sir respectfully yours william wordsworth <\s>
<s> rydal mount january 1816 <\s>
<s> 5 it was deemed that it would be so and the letter is published accordingly <\s>
<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>

<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>

<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>
<s> but to be serious <\s>
<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>
<s> the question lies between spite and presumption and it is not easy to decide upon a case where the claims of each party are so strong but the name of aristarch who simple man <\s>
<s> would allow no verse to pass for homer's which he did not approve of is retained for reasons that will be deemed cogent <\s>
<s> fortunate is it for the world when this spirit incites only to actions that meet with an adequate punishment in derision such as in a scheme of poetical justice would be aptly requited by assigning to the agents when they quit this lower world a station in that not uncomfortable limbo the paradise of fools <\s>
<s> but assuredly we shall have here another proof that ridicule is not the test of truth if it prevent us from perceiving that depravity has no ally more active more inveterate nor from the difficulty of divining to what kind and degree of extravagance it may prompt more pernicious than self conceit <\s>
<s> where this alliance is too obvious to be disputed the culprit ought not to be allowed the benefit of contempt as a shelter from detestation much less should he be permitted to plead in excuse for his transgressions that especial malevolence had little or no part in them <\s>
<s> it is not recorded that the ancient who set fire to the temple of diana had a particular dislike to the goddess of chastity or held idolatry in abhorrence he was a fool an egregious fool but not the less on that account a most odious monster <\s>
<s> the tyrant who is described as having rattled his chariot along a bridge of brass over the heads of his subjects was no doubt inwardly laughed at but what if this mock jupiter not satisfied with an empty noise of his own making had amused himself with throwing fire brands upon the house tops as a substitute for lightning and from his elevation had hurled stones upon the heads of his people to show that he was a master of the destructive bolt as well as of the harmless voice of the thunder the lovers of all that is honourable to humanity have recently had occasion to rejoice over the downfall of an intoxicated despot whose vagaries furnish more solid materials by which the philosopher will exemplify how strict is the connection between the ludicrously and the terribly fantastic <\s>
<s> we know also that robespierre was one of the vainest men that the most vain country upon earth has produced and from this passion and from that cowardice which naturally connects itself with it flowed the horrors of his administration <\s>

<s> 5 it was deemed that it would be so and the letter is published accordingly <\s>
<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>
<s> trusting that these opinions of an individual will be candidly interpreted i have the honour to be your obedient servant w <\s>

<s> rydal mount april 8 <\s>
<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>

<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>

<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>

<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>

<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>

<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>

<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>

<s> but assuredly we shall have here another proof that ridicule is not the test of truth if it prevent us from perceiving that depravity has no ally more active more inveterate nor from the difficulty of divining to what kind and degree of extravagance it may prompt more pernicious than self conceit <\s>

<s> the tyrant who is described as having rattled his chariot along a bridge of brass over the heads of his subjects was no doubt inwardly laughed at but what if this mock jupiter not satisfied with an empty noise of his own making had amused himself with throwing fire brands upon the house tops as a substitute for lightning and from his elevation had hurled stones upon the heads of his people to show that he was a master of the destructive bolt as well as of the harmless voice of the thunder the lovers of all that is honourable to humanity have recently had occasion to rejoice over the downfall of an intoxicated despot whose vagaries furnish more solid materials by which the philosopher will exemplify how strict is the connection between the ludicrously and the terribly fantastic <\s>

<s> the transition from a vindication of robert burns to these hints for a picture of the intellectual deformity of one who has grossly outraged his memory is too natural to require an apology but i feel sir that i stand in need of indulgence for having detained you so long <\s>
<s> let me beg that you would impart to any judicious friends of the poet as much of the contents of these pages as you think will be serviceable to the cause but do not give publicity to any portion of them unless it be thought probable that an open circulation of the whole may be useful 5 the subject is delicate and some of the opinions are of a kind which if torn away from the trunk that supports them will be apt to wither and in that state to contract poisonous qualities like the branches of the yew which while united by a living spirit to their native tree are neither noxious nor without beauty but being dissevered and cast upon the ground become deadly to the cattle that incautiously feed upon them <\s>
<s> gilbert burns especially let my sentiments be conveyed with my sincere respects and best wishes for the success of his praise worthy enterprize <\s>
<s> and if through modest apprehension he should doubt of his own ability to do justice to his brother's memory let him take encouragement from the assurance that the most odious part of the charges owed its credit to the silence of those who were deemed best entitled to speak and who it was thought would not have been mute had they believed that they could speak beneficially <\s>
<s> moreover it may be relied on as a general truth which will not escape his recollection that tasks of this kind are not so arduous as to those who are tenderly concerned in their issue they may at first appear to be for if the many be hasty to condemn there is a re action of generosity which stimulates them when forcibly summoned to redress the wrong and for the sensible part of mankind they are neither dull to understand nor slow to make allowance for the aberrations of men whose intellectual powers do honour to their species <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>

<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>

<s> i am dear sir respectfully yours william wordsworth <\s>

<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>

<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>
<s> frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others <\s>
<s> who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow minded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam o'shanter <\s>
<s> the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities <\s>
<s> this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusion the night is driven on by song and tumultuous noise laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palate conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence selfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordiality and while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment within i pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect <\s>
<s> kings may be blest but tam was glorious o'er a the ills of life victorious <\s>
<s> what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble him men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve <\s>
<s> the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherish and as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved <\s>
<s> not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic self introduced as a dramatic personage for the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments <\s>
<s> his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr <\s>
<s> hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor <\s>
<s> yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations <\s>
<s> and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon <\s>
<s> but whether she had three or four he could na tell <\s>
<s> behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself <\s>
<s> coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate <\s>
<s> but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors <\s>
<s> we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own hand in words the import of which cannot be mistaken it has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views <\s>
<s> it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting <\s>
<s> for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c <\s>
<s> could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering <\s>
<s> whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that thoughtless follies laid him low and stained his name <\s>
<s> who but himself himself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course <\s>
<s> here is a sincere and solemn avowal a public declaration from his own will a confession at once devout poetical and human a history in the shape of a prophecy <\s>
<s> what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authentic lastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that right which with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of self respect he was not negligent to maintain for them the right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure <\s>
<s> you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr <\s>
<s> currie's book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves <\s>
<s> of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize <\s>
<s> the edinburgh reviewer and him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justice the edinburgh reviewer thus writes :[ 3 the leading vice in burns's character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful <\s>
<s> we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else i e <\s>
<s> boasting of his own independence marvellous address in the commission of faults <\s>
<s> not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment <\s>
<s> but to be serious <\s>
<s> when a man self elected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c <\s>

<s> it is notorious that this persevering aristarch 4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to re proclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension <\s>
<s> the happy self complacency the unsuspecting vain glory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept <\s>
<s> what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offender's condition would not then have been so hopeless <\s>
<s> for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt <\s>
<s> malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable <\s>
<s> 4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted <\s>
<s> the question lies between spite and presumption and it is not easy to decide upon a case where the claims of each party are so strong but the name of aristarch who simple man <\s>
<s> would allow no verse to pass for homer's which he did not approve of is retained for reasons that will be deemed cogent <\s>
<s> fortunate is it for the world when this spirit incites only to actions that meet with an adequate punishment in derision such as in a scheme of poetical justice would be aptly requited by assigning to the agents when they quit this lower world a station in that not uncomfortable limbo the paradise of fools <\s>

<s> i am dear sir respectfully yours william wordsworth <\s>
<s> rydal mount january 1816 <\s>
<s> 5 it was deemed that it would be so and the letter is published accordingly <\s>
<s> b of monuments to literary men <\s>
<s> letter to a friend <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 21 <\s>
<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>

<s> peace you have gratified me by what you say of sir thomas browne <\s>
<s> and of poets more especially it is true that if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished <\s>
<s> it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved <\s>
<s> it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum <\s>
<s> you will interpret what i am writing liberally <\s>
<s> with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections <\s>
<s> the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance <\s>
<s> but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably <\s>
<s> should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure <\s>
<s> far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors <\s>
<s> this is eminently the case with the effusions of burns in the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama <\s>
<s> neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author <\s>
<s> on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses <\s>
<s> this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritual and though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive <\s>
<s> plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound <\s>
<s> granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to misery the more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of genius we needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetry to please and to instruct <\s>
<s> in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be found in the walks of nature and in the business of men the poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderate from convivial pleasure though intemperate nor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation <\s>

<s> and if through modest apprehension he should doubt of his own ability to do justice to his brother's memory let him take encouragement from the assurance that the most odious part of the charges owed its credit to the silence of those who were deemed best entitled to speak and who it was thought would not have been mute had they believed that they could speak beneficially <\s>
<s> moreover it may be relied on as a general truth which will not escape his recollection that tasks of this kind are not so arduous as to those who are tenderly concerned in their issue they may at first appear to be for if the many be hasty to condemn there is a re action of generosity which stimulates them when forcibly summoned to redress the wrong and for the sensible part of mankind they are neither dull to understand nor slow to make allowance for the aberrations of men whose intellectual powers do honour to their species <\s>

<s> sir the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object <\s>
<s> sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent <\s>
<s> in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous <\s>
<s> burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts <\s>
<s> in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant <\s>
<s> but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland <\s>
<s> if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides <\s>
<s> it appears to me that towards no class of his majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive <\s>
<s> the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations <\s>
<s> this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honours honours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professions why the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged <\s>
<s> but to recur to the proposal in your letter <\s>
<s> i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope <\s>
<s> at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning <\s>
<s> i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tender hearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination <\s>
<s> let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do <\s>
<s> gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals <\s>
<s> let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature <\s>
<s> trusting that these opinions of an individual will be candidly interpreted i have the honour to be your obedient servant w <\s>
