<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>

<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>

<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>

<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>

<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>

<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>

<s> besides where respect is not perverted where the world is not taught to reverence men without regarding their conduct the esteem of mankind will have a very different value and when a proper independence is secured will be regarded as a sufficient recompense for services however important and will be a much surer guarantee of the continuance of such virtues as may deserve it <\s>
<s> i have another strong objection to nobility which is that it has a necessary tendency to dishonour labour a prejudice which extends far beyond its own circle that it binds down whole ranks of men to idleness while it gives the enjoyment of a reward which exceeds the hopes of the most active exertions of human industry <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>

<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>

<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>

<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>

<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>

<s> i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority <\s>
<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>
<s> considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the state and it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this ground what services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings <\s>
<s> but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them <\s>
<s> what services then can a man render to society to compensate for the outrage done to the dignity of our nature when we bind ourselves to address him and his posterity with humiliating circumlocutions calling him most noble most honourable most high most august serene excellent eminent and so forth when it is more than probable that such unnatural flattery will but generate vices which ought to consign him to neglect and solitude or make him the perpetual object of the finger of scorn <\s>
<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>
<s> it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume <\s>
<s> vice which is forgiven in one character will soon cease to meet with sternness of rebuke when found in others <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>

<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>

<s> the audience were not a little surprised to be told on the drawing up of the curtain that from circumstances of particular convenience it was hoped they would dispense with the omission of the character of hamlet <\s>
<s> but to be serious for the subject is serious in the extreme from your silence respecting the general call for a parliamentary reform supported by your assertion that we at present enjoy as great a portion of liberty and equality as is consistent with civil society what can be supposed but that you are a determined enemy to the redress of what the people of england call and feel to be grievances <\s>
<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>

<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>

<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>

<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>
<s> but other arbitrary distinctions exist among mankind either from choice or usurpation <\s>
<s> i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority <\s>
<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>
<s> considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the state and it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this ground what services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings <\s>
<s> but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them <\s>

<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>
<s> it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume <\s>
<s> vice which is forgiven in one character will soon cease to meet with sternness of rebuke when found in others <\s>
<s> even at first she will entreat pardon with confidence assured that ere long she will be charitably supposed to stand in no need of it <\s>
<s> but let me ask you seriously from the mode in which those distinctions are originally conferred is it not almost necessary that far from being the rewards of services rendered to the state they should usually be the recompense of an industrious sacrifice of the general welfare to the particular aggrandisement of that power by which they are bestowed <\s>
<s> let us even alter their source and consider them as proceeding from the nation itself and deprived of that hereditary quality even here i should proscribe them and for the most evident reason that a man's past services are no sufficient security for his future character he who to day merits the civic wreath may to morrow deserve the tarpeian rock <\s>
<s> besides where respect is not perverted where the world is not taught to reverence men without regarding their conduct the esteem of mankind will have a very different value and when a proper independence is secured will be regarded as a sufficient recompense for services however important and will be a much surer guarantee of the continuance of such virtues as may deserve it <\s>
<s> i have another strong objection to nobility which is that it has a necessary tendency to dishonour labour a prejudice which extends far beyond its own circle that it binds down whole ranks of men to idleness while it gives the enjoyment of a reward which exceeds the hopes of the most active exertions of human industry <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>

<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>

<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>

<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>

<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>

<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>

<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>

<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>

<s> i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority <\s>
<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>
<s> considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the state and it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this ground what services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings <\s>
<s> but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them <\s>
<s> what services then can a man render to society to compensate for the outrage done to the dignity of our nature when we bind ourselves to address him and his posterity with humiliating circumlocutions calling him most noble most honourable most high most august serene excellent eminent and so forth when it is more than probable that such unnatural flattery will but generate vices which ought to consign him to neglect and solitude or make him the perpetual object of the finger of scorn <\s>
<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>
<s> it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>

<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>

<s> the audience were not a little surprised to be told on the drawing up of the curtain that from circumstances of particular convenience it was hoped they would dispense with the omission of the character of hamlet <\s>
<s> but to be serious for the subject is serious in the extreme from your silence respecting the general call for a parliamentary reform supported by your assertion that we at present enjoy as great a portion of liberty and equality as is consistent with civil society what can be supposed but that you are a determined enemy to the redress of what the people of england call and feel to be grievances <\s>
<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>

<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>

<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>

<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>
<s> but other arbitrary distinctions exist among mankind either from choice or usurpation <\s>
<s> i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority <\s>
<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>
<s> considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the state and it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this ground what services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings <\s>
<s> but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them <\s>

<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>
<s> it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume <\s>
<s> vice which is forgiven in one character will soon cease to meet with sternness of rebuke when found in others <\s>
<s> even at first she will entreat pardon with confidence assured that ere long she will be charitably supposed to stand in no need of it <\s>
<s> but let me ask you seriously from the mode in which those distinctions are originally conferred is it not almost necessary that far from being the rewards of services rendered to the state they should usually be the recompense of an industrious sacrifice of the general welfare to the particular aggrandisement of that power by which they are bestowed <\s>
<s> let us even alter their source and consider them as proceeding from the nation itself and deprived of that hereditary quality even here i should proscribe them and for the most evident reason that a man's past services are no sufficient security for his future character he who to day merits the civic wreath may to morrow deserve the tarpeian rock <\s>
<s> besides where respect is not perverted where the world is not taught to reverence men without regarding their conduct the esteem of mankind will have a very different value and when a proper independence is secured will be regarded as a sufficient recompense for services however important and will be a much surer guarantee of the continuance of such virtues as may deserve it <\s>
<s> i have another strong objection to nobility which is that it has a necessary tendency to dishonour labour a prejudice which extends far beyond its own circle that it binds down whole ranks of men to idleness while it gives the enjoyment of a reward which exceeds the hopes of the most active exertions of human industry <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>

<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>

<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>

<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>

<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>

<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>

<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>

<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>

<s> i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority <\s>
<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>
<s> considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the state and it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this ground what services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings <\s>
<s> but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them <\s>
<s> what services then can a man render to society to compensate for the outrage done to the dignity of our nature when we bind ourselves to address him and his posterity with humiliating circumlocutions calling him most noble most honourable most high most august serene excellent eminent and so forth when it is more than probable that such unnatural flattery will but generate vices which ought to consign him to neglect and solitude or make him the perpetual object of the finger of scorn <\s>
<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>
<s> it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>

<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>

<s> the audience were not a little surprised to be told on the drawing up of the curtain that from circumstances of particular convenience it was hoped they would dispense with the omission of the character of hamlet <\s>
<s> but to be serious for the subject is serious in the extreme from your silence respecting the general call for a parliamentary reform supported by your assertion that we at present enjoy as great a portion of liberty and equality as is consistent with civil society what can be supposed but that you are a determined enemy to the redress of what the people of england call and feel to be grievances <\s>
<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>

<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>

<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>

<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>
<s> but other arbitrary distinctions exist among mankind either from choice or usurpation <\s>
<s> i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority <\s>
<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>
<s> considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the state and it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this ground what services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings <\s>
<s> but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them <\s>

<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>
<s> it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume <\s>
<s> vice which is forgiven in one character will soon cease to meet with sternness of rebuke when found in others <\s>
<s> even at first she will entreat pardon with confidence assured that ere long she will be charitably supposed to stand in no need of it <\s>
<s> but let me ask you seriously from the mode in which those distinctions are originally conferred is it not almost necessary that far from being the rewards of services rendered to the state they should usually be the recompense of an industrious sacrifice of the general welfare to the particular aggrandisement of that power by which they are bestowed <\s>
<s> let us even alter their source and consider them as proceeding from the nation itself and deprived of that hereditary quality even here i should proscribe them and for the most evident reason that a man's past services are no sufficient security for his future character he who to day merits the civic wreath may to morrow deserve the tarpeian rock <\s>
<s> besides where respect is not perverted where the world is not taught to reverence men without regarding their conduct the esteem of mankind will have a very different value and when a proper independence is secured will be regarded as a sufficient recompense for services however important and will be a much surer guarantee of the continuance of such virtues as may deserve it <\s>
<s> i have another strong objection to nobility which is that it has a necessary tendency to dishonour labour a prejudice which extends far beyond its own circle that it binds down whole ranks of men to idleness while it gives the enjoyment of a reward which exceeds the hopes of the most active exertions of human industry <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>

<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>

<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>

<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>

<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>

<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>

<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>

<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>

<s> i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority <\s>
<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>
<s> considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the state and it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this ground what services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings <\s>
<s> but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them <\s>
<s> what services then can a man render to society to compensate for the outrage done to the dignity of our nature when we bind ourselves to address him and his posterity with humiliating circumlocutions calling him most noble most honourable most high most august serene excellent eminent and so forth when it is more than probable that such unnatural flattery will but generate vices which ought to consign him to neglect and solitude or make him the perpetual object of the finger of scorn <\s>
<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>
<s> it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>

<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>

<s> the audience were not a little surprised to be told on the drawing up of the curtain that from circumstances of particular convenience it was hoped they would dispense with the omission of the character of hamlet <\s>
<s> but to be serious for the subject is serious in the extreme from your silence respecting the general call for a parliamentary reform supported by your assertion that we at present enjoy as great a portion of liberty and equality as is consistent with civil society what can be supposed but that you are a determined enemy to the redress of what the people of england call and feel to be grievances <\s>
<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>

<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>

<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>

<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>
<s> but other arbitrary distinctions exist among mankind either from choice or usurpation <\s>
<s> i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority <\s>
<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>
<s> considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the state and it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this ground what services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings <\s>
<s> but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them <\s>

<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>
<s> it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume <\s>
<s> vice which is forgiven in one character will soon cease to meet with sternness of rebuke when found in others <\s>
<s> even at first she will entreat pardon with confidence assured that ere long she will be charitably supposed to stand in no need of it <\s>
<s> but let me ask you seriously from the mode in which those distinctions are originally conferred is it not almost necessary that far from being the rewards of services rendered to the state they should usually be the recompense of an industrious sacrifice of the general welfare to the particular aggrandisement of that power by which they are bestowed <\s>
<s> let us even alter their source and consider them as proceeding from the nation itself and deprived of that hereditary quality even here i should proscribe them and for the most evident reason that a man's past services are no sufficient security for his future character he who to day merits the civic wreath may to morrow deserve the tarpeian rock <\s>
<s> besides where respect is not perverted where the world is not taught to reverence men without regarding their conduct the esteem of mankind will have a very different value and when a proper independence is secured will be regarded as a sufficient recompense for services however important and will be a much surer guarantee of the continuance of such virtues as may deserve it <\s>
<s> i have another strong objection to nobility which is that it has a necessary tendency to dishonour labour a prejudice which extends far beyond its own circle that it binds down whole ranks of men to idleness while it gives the enjoyment of a reward which exceeds the hopes of the most active exertions of human industry <\s>

<s> my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes <\s>
<s> where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic <\s>
<s> the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours <\s>
<s> but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him <\s>
<s> this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor <\s>
<s> that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution <\s>
<s> as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic <\s>
<s> and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal <\s>
<s> pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy <\s>
<s> it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical <\s>
<s> they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished <\s>
<s> it was so in france and .... <\s>
<s> i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist <\s>
<s> you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordship's success has not answered your trouble <\s>
<s> if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience <\s>
<s> here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power <\s>
<s> in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution <\s>
<s> government is at best but a necessary evil <\s>
<s> compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right <\s>
<s> nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power <\s>
<s> on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another also that in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves <\s>
<s> another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry <\s>
<s> it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government <\s>
<s> in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality <\s>
<s> he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done <\s>
<s> the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle <\s>
<s> aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors <\s>
<s> if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim <\s>
<s> they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family <\s>
<s> i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence <\s>
<s> your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable <\s>
<s> for my part i am more enthusiastic <\s>
<s> the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support <\s>
<s> if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions <\s>
<s> i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society <\s>
<s> thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society <\s>
<s> but other arbitrary distinctions exist among mankind either from choice or usurpation <\s>
<s> i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority <\s>
<s> your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral <\s>
<s> considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the state and it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this ground what services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings <\s>
<s> but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them <\s>
<s> what services then can a man render to society to compensate for the outrage done to the dignity of our nature when we bind ourselves to address him and his posterity with humiliating circumlocutions calling him most noble most honourable most high most august serene excellent eminent and so forth when it is more than probable that such unnatural flattery will but generate vices which ought to consign him to neglect and solitude or make him the perpetual object of the finger of scorn <\s>
<s> and does not experience justify the observation that where titles a thing very rare have been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation <\s>
<s> it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume <\s>
<s> vice which is forgiven in one character will soon cease to meet with sternness of rebuke when found in others <\s>
<s> even at first she will entreat pardon with confidence assured that ere long she will be charitably supposed to stand in no need of it <\s>
<s> but let me ask you seriously from the mode in which those distinctions are originally conferred is it not almost necessary that far from being the rewards of services rendered to the state they should usually be the recompense of an industrious sacrifice of the general welfare to the particular aggrandisement of that power by which they are bestowed <\s>

<s> besides where respect is not perverted where the world is not taught to reverence men without regarding their conduct the esteem of mankind will have a very different value and when a proper independence is secured will be regarded as a sufficient recompense for services however important and will be a much surer guarantee of the continuance of such virtues as may deserve it <\s>
