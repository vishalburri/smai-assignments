<s> w in a letter to the bishop a copy of which in his own beautiful handwriting now lies before me thus expresses himself <\s>
<s> if he meaning the person in whom the difficulty originated had suggested any such objection before i should utterly have declined any attempt to the curacy of ulpha indeed i was always apprehensive it might be disagreeable to my auditory at seathwaite as they have been always accustomed to double duty and the inhabitants of ulpha despair of being able to support a schoolmaster who is not curate there also which suppressed all thoughts in me of serving them both <\s>
<s> and in a second letter to the bishop he writes my lord i have the favour of yours of the 1st instant and am exceedingly obliged on account of the ulpha affair if that curacy should lapse into your lordship's hands i would beg leave rather to decline than embrace it for the chapels of seathwaite and ulpha annexed together would be apt to cause a general discontent among the inhabitants of both places by either thinking themselves slighted being only served alternately or neglected in the duty or attributing it to covetousness in me all which occasions of murmuring i would willingly avoid <\s>
<s> and in concluding his former letter he expresses a similar sentiment upon the same occasion desiring if it be possible however as much as in me lieth to live peaceably with all men <\s>
<s> the year following the curacy of seathwaite was again augmented and to effect this augmentation fifty pounds had been advanced by himself and in 1760 lands were purchased with eight hundred pounds <\s>

<s> to quit a situation where he had been so long happy with a consciousness of being useful <\s>

<s> after all the traveller would be most gratified who should approach this beautiful stream neither at its source as is done in the sonnets nor from its termination but from coniston over walna scar first descending into a little circular valley a collateral compartment of the long winding vale through which flows the duddon <\s>

<s> issuing from the plain of this valley the brook descends in a rapid torrent passing by the churchyard of seathwaite <\s>

<s> of the excursion in the year 1709 robert walker was born at under crag in seathwaite he was the youngest of twelve children <\s>
<s> his eldest brother who inherited the small family estate died at under crag aged ninety four being twenty four years older than the subject of this memoir who was born of the same mother <\s>
<s> robert was a sickly infant and through his boyhood and youth continuing to be of delicate frame and tender health it was deemed best according to the country phrase to breed him a scholar for it was not likely that he would be able to earn a livelihood by bodily labour <\s>
<s> at that period few of these dales were furnished with schoolhouses the children being taught to read and write in the chapel and in the same consecrated building where he officiated for so many years both as preacher and schoolmaster he himself received the rudiments of his education <\s>
<s> in his youth he became schoolmaster at loweswater not being called upon probably in that situation to teach more than reading writing and arithmetic <\s>
<s> but by the assistance of a gentleman in the neighbourhood he acquired at leisure hours a knowledge of the classics and became qualified for taking holy orders <\s>
<s> upon his ordination he had the offer of two curacies the one torver in the vale of coniston the other seathwaite in his native vale <\s>
<s> the value of each was the same viz five pounds per annum but the cure of seathwaite having a cottage attached to it as he wished to marry he chose it in preference <\s>
<s> the young person on whom his affections were fixed though in the condition of a domestic servant had given promise by her serious and modest deportment and by her virtuous dispositions that she was worthy to become the helpmate of a man entering upon a plan of life such as he had marked out for himself <\s>
<s> by her frugality she had stored up a small sum of money with which they began house keeping <\s>
<s> in 1735 or 1736 he entered upon his curacy and nineteen years afterwards his situation is thus described in some letters to be found in the annual register for 1760 from which the following is extracted to mr <\s>
<s> coniston july 26 1754 <\s>
<s> sir i was the other day upon a party of pleasure about five or six miles from this place where i met with a very striking object and of a nature not very common <\s>
<s> going into a clergyman's house of whom i had frequently heard i found him sitting at the head of a long square table such as is commonly used in this country by the lower class of people dressed in a coarse blue frock trimmed with black horn buttons a checked shirt a leathern strap about his neck for a stock a coarse apron and a pair of great wooden soled shoes plated with iron to preserve them what we call clogs in these parts with a child upon his knee eating his breakfast his wife and the remainder of his children were some of them employed in waiting upon each other the rest in teasing and spinning wool at which trade he is a great proficient and moreover when it is made ready for sale will lay it by sixteen or thirty two pounds weight upon his back and on foot seven or eight miles will carry it to the market even in the depth of winter <\s>
<s> i was not much surprised at all this as you may possibly be having heard a great deal of it related before <\s>
<s> but i must confess myself astonished with the alacrity and the good humour that appeared both in the clergyman and his wife and more so at the sense and ingenuity of the clergyman himself ... <\s>
<s> then follows a letter from another person dated 1755 from which an extract shall be given <\s>
<s> by his frugality and good management he keeps the wolf from the door as we say and if he advances a little in the world it is owing more to his own care than to anything else he has to rely upon <\s>
<s> i don't find his inclination is running after further preferment <\s>
<s> he is settled among the people that are happy among themselves and lives in the greatest unanimity and friendship with them and i believe the minister and people are exceedingly satisfied with each other and indeed how should they be dissatisfied when they have a person of so much worth and probity for their pastor <\s>
<s> a man who for his candour and meekness his sober chaste and virtuous conversation his soundness in principle and practice is an ornament to his profession and an honour to the country he is in and bear with me if i say the plainness of his dress the sanctity of his manners the simplicity of his doctrine and the vehemence of his expression have a sort of resemblance to the pure practice of primitive christianity <\s>
