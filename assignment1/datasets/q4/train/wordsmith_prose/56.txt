<s> the whole was written before the close of the year 1794 and i will detail rather as a matter of literary biography than for any other reason the circumstances under which it was produced <\s>
<s> during the latter part of the summer of 1793 having passed a month in the isle of wight in view of the fleet which was then preparing for sea off portsmouth at the commencement of the war i left the place with melancholy forebodings <\s>

<s> after leaving the isle of wight i spent two days in wandering on foot over salisbury plain which though cultivation was then widely spread through parts of it had upon the whole a still more impressive appearance than it now retains <\s>

<s> not less than one third of the following poem though it has from time to time been altered in the expression was published so far back as the year 1798 under the title of the female vagrant <\s>

<s> the whole was written before the close of the year 1794 and i will detail rather as a matter of literary biography than for any other reason the circumstances under which it was produced <\s>
<s> during the latter part of the summer of 1793 having passed a month in the isle of wight in view of the fleet which was then preparing for sea off portsmouth at the commencement of the war i left the place with melancholy forebodings <\s>

<s> after leaving the isle of wight i spent two days in wandering on foot over salisbury plain which though cultivation was then widely spread through parts of it had upon the whole a still more impressive appearance than it now retains <\s>

<s> this fault was corrected nearly fifty years afterwards when i determined to publish the whole <\s>
<s> it may be worth while to remark that though the incidents of this attempt do only in a small degree produce each other and it deviates accordingly from the general rule by which narrative pieces ought to be governed it is not therefore wanting in continuous hold upon the mind or in unity which is effected by the identity of moral interest that places the two personages upon the same footing in the reader's sympathies <\s>
<s> my ramble over many parts of salisbury plain put me as mentioned in the preface upon writing this poem and left upon my mind imaginative impressions the force of which i have felt to this day <\s>
<s> from that district i proceeded to bath bristol and so on to the banks of the wye when i took again to travelling on foot <\s>
<s> in remembrance of that part of my journey which was in 1793 i began the verses five years have passed c <\s>

<s> xii this was an overflow from the affliction of margaret and excluded as superfluous there but preserved in the faint hope that it may turn to account by restoring a shy lover to some forsaken damsel my poetry having been complained of as deficient in interests of this sort a charge which the next piece beginning lyre <\s>
<s> though such power do in thy magic live <\s>
<s> will scarcely tend to obviate <\s>
<s> the natural imagery of these verses was supplied by frequent i might say intense observation of the rydal torrent <\s>
<s> what an animating contrast is the ever changing aspect of that and indeed of every one of our mountain brooks to the monotonous tone and unmitigated fury of such streams among the alps as are fed all the summer long by glaciers and melting snows <\s>
<s> a traveller observing the exquisite purity of the great rivers such as the rhone at geneva and the reuss at lucerne where they issue out of their respective lakes might fancy for a moment that some power in nature produced this beautiful change with a view to make amends for those alpine sullyings which the waters exhibit near their fountain heads but alas <\s>
<s> how soon does that purity depart before the influx of tributary waters that have flowed through cultivated plains and the crowded abodes of men <\s>
<s> the borderers a tragedy <\s>
<s> of this dramatic work i have little to say in addition to the short printed note which will be found attached to it <\s>
<s> it was composed at racedown in dorset during the latter part of the year 1795 and in the course of the following year <\s>
<s> had it been the work of a later period of life it would have been different in some respects from what it is now <\s>
<s> the plot would have been something more complex and a greater variety of characters introduced to relieve the mind from the pressure of incidents so mournful the manners also would have been more attended to <\s>
<s> my care was almost exclusively given to the passions and the characters and the position in which the persons in the drama stood relatively to each other that the reader for i never thought of the stage at the time it was written might be moved and to a degree instructed by lights penetrating somewhat into the depths of our nature <\s>
<s> in this endeavour i cannot think upon a very late review that i have failed <\s>
<s> as to the scene and period of action little more was required for my purpose than the absence of established law and government so that the agents might be at liberty to act on their own impulses <\s>
<s> nevertheless i do remember that having a wish to colour the manners in some degree from local history more than my knowledge enabled me to do i read redpath's history of the borders but found there nothing to my purpose <\s>
<s> i once made an observation to sir w <\s>
<s> scott in which he concurred that it was difficult to conceive how so dull a book could be written on such a subject <\s>
<s> much about the same time but a little after coleridge was employed in writing his tragedy of remorse and it happened soon after that through one of the mr <\s>
<s> knight the actor heard that we had been engaged in writing plays and upon his suggestion mine was curtailed and i believe with coleridge's was offered to mr <\s>
<s> harris manager of covent garden <\s>
<s> for myself i had no hope nor even a wish though a successful play would in the then state of my finances have been a most welcome piece of good fortune that he should accept my performance so that i incurred no disappointment when the piece was judiciously returned as not calculated for the stage <\s>
<s> in this judgment i entirely concurred and had it been otherwise it was so natural for me to shrink from public notice that any hope i might have had of success would not have reconciled me altogether to such an exhibition <\s>
<s> c s play was as is well known brought forward several years after through the kindness of mr <\s>
<s> in conclusion i may observe that while i was composing this play i wrote a short essay illustrative of that constitution and those tendencies of human nature which make the apparently motiveless actions of bad men intelligible to careful observers <\s>
<s> this was partly done with reference to the character of oswald and his persevering endeavour to lead the man he disliked into so heinous a crime but still more to preserve in my distinct remembrance what i had observed of transitions in character and the reflections i had been led to make during the time i was a witness of the changes through which the french revolution passed <\s>
<s> the following is the short printed note mentioned in above this dramatic piece as noticed in its title page was composed in 1795 6 <\s>
<s> it lay nearly from that time till within the last two or three months unregarded among my papers without being mentioned even to my most intimate friends <\s>
<s> having however impressions upon my mind which made me unwilling to destroy the ms i determined to undertake the responsibility of publishing it during my own life rather than impose upon my successors the task of deciding its fate <\s>
<s> accordingly it has been revised with some care but as it was at first written and is now published without any view to its exhibition upon the stage not the slightest alteration has been made in the conduct of the story or the composition of the characters above all in respect to the two leading persons of the drama i felt no inducement to make any change <\s>
<s> the study of human nature suggests this awful truth that as in the trial to which life subjects us sin and crime are apt to start from their very opposite qualities so are there no limits to the hardening of the heart and the perversion of the understanding to which they may carry their slaves <\s>
<s> during my long residence in france while the revolution was rapidly advancing to its extreme of wickedness i had frequent opportunities of being an eye witness of this process and it was while that knowledge was fresh upon my memory that the tragedy of the borderers was composed <\s>
<s> later this was prefixed readers already acquainted with my poems will recognise in the following composition some eight or ten lines which i have not scrupled to retain in the places where they originally stood <\s>
<s> it is proper however to add that they would not have been used elsewhere if i had foreseen the time when i might be induced to publish this tragedy <\s>

<s> the humbleness meanness if you like of the subject together with the homely mode of treating it brought upon me a world of ridicule by the small critics so that in policy i excluded it from many editions of my poems till it was restored at the request of some of my friends in particular my son in law edward quillinan <\s>
