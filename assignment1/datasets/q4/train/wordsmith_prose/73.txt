<s> 1 2 upon the head of the columns which form the front of the cave rests a body of decomposed basaltic matter which was richly decorated with that large bright flower the ox eyed daisy <\s>
<s> i had noticed the same flower growing with profusion among the bold rocks on the western coast of the isle of man making a brilliant contrast with their black and gloomy surfaces <\s>
<s> xxxiii the four last lines of this sonnet are adapted from a well known sonnet of russel as conveying my feeling better than any words of my own could do <\s>
<s> river eden xxxviii yet fetched from paradise <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that there is more of the poet than the sound etymologist in this derivation of the name eden <\s>
<s> on the western coast of cumberland is a rivulet which enters the sea at moresby known also in the neighbourhood by the name of eden <\s>
<s> may not the latter syllable come from the word dean a valley <\s>
<s> langdale near ambleside is by the inhabitants called langden <\s>
<s> the former syllable occurs in the name emont a principal feeder of the eden and the stream which flows when the tide is out over cartmel sands is called the ea eau french aqua latin <\s>
<s> ibid nature gives thee flowers that have no rival amidst british bowers <\s>
<s> this can scarcely be true to the letter but without stretching the point at all i can say that the soil and air appear more congenial with many upon the bank of this river than i have observed in any other parts of great britain <\s>
<s> xxxix before this monument was put up in the chapel at wetheral i saw it in the sculptor's studio <\s>
<s> nollekens who by the bye was a strange and grotesque figure that interfered much with one's admiration of his works showed me at the same time the various models in clay which he had made one after another of the mother and her infant <\s>
<s> the improvement on each was surprising and how so much grace beauty and tenderness had come out of such a head i was sadly puzzled to conceive <\s>
<s> upon a window seat in his parlour lay two casts of faces one of the duchess of devonshire so noted in her day and the other of mr <\s>
<s> pitt taken after his death a ghastly resemblance as these things always are even when taken from the living subject and more ghastly in this instance of mr <\s>
<s> pitt from the peculiarity of the features <\s>
<s> the heedless and apparently neglectful manner in which the faces of these two persons were left the one so distinguished in london society and the other upon whose counsels and public conduct during a most momentous period depended the fate of this great empire and perhaps of all europe afforded a lesson to which the dullest of casual visitors could scarcely be insensible <\s>
<s> it touched me the more because i had so often seen mr <\s>
<s> pitt upon his own ground at cambridge and upon the floor of the house of commons <\s>
<s> xli i became acquainted with the walks of nunnery when a boy <\s>
<s> they are within easy reach of a day's pleasant excursion from the town of penrith where i used to pass my summer holidays under the roof of my maternal grandfather <\s>
<s> the place is well worth visiting tho within these few years its privacy and therefore the pleasure which the scene is so well fitted to give has been injuriously affected by walks cut in the rocks on that side the stream which had been left in its natural state <\s>
<s> xlii canal and viaduct and railway tell <\s>
<s> at corby a few miles below nunnery the eden is crossed by a magnificent viaduct and another of these works is thrown over a deep glen or ravine at a very short distance from the main stream <\s>
<s> xliii a weight of awe not easy to be borne <\s>
<s> the daughters of long meg placed in a perfect circle eighty yards in diameter are seventy two in number above ground a little way out of the circle stands long meg herself a single stone eighteen feet high <\s>
<s> when i first saw this monument as i came upon it by surprise i might over rate its importance as an object but though it will not bear a comparison with stonehenge i must say i have not seen any other relique of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> it may be questioned whether this union was in the contemplation of the artist when he planned the edifice <\s>
<s> however this might be a poet may be excused for taking the view of the subject presented in this sonnet <\s>
<s> to the earl of lonsdale <\s>
<s> xlv this sonnet was written immediately after certain trials which took place at the cumberland assizes when the earl of lonsdale in consequence of repeated and long continued attacks upon his character through the local press had thought it right to prosecute the conductors and proprietors of three several journals <\s>
<s> a verdict of libel was given in one case and in the others the prosecutions were withdrawn upon the individuals retracting and disavowing the charges expressing regret that they had been made and promising to abstain from the like in future <\s>
<s> xlvi this poem might be dedicated to my friend sir g <\s>
<s> while we were making an excursion together in this part of the lake district we heard that mr <\s>
<s> glover the artist while lodging at lyulph's tower had been disturbed by a loud shriek and upon rising he learnt that it had come from a young woman in the house who was in the habit of walking in her sleep <\s>
<s> in that state she had gone down stairs and while attempting to open the outer door either from some difficulty or the effect of the cold stone upon her feet had uttered the cry which alarmed him <\s>
<s> it seemed to us all that this might serve as a hint for a poem and the story here told was constructed and soon after put into verse by me as it now stands <\s>
<s> note lyulph's tower' a pleasure house built by the late duke of norfolk upon the banks of ullswater <\s>
<s> force is the word used in the lake district for waterfall xviii <\s>
<s> poems of sentiment and reflection <\s>
<s> i this poem is a favourite among the quakers as i have learnt on many occasions <\s>
<s> it was composed in front of the house at alfoxden in the spring of 1798 <\s>
<s> ii composed at the same time as expostulation and reply <\s>
<s> lines written in early spring <\s>
<s> actually composed while i was sitting by the side of the brook that runs down from the comb in which stands the village of alford through the grounds of alfoxden <\s>
<s> it was a chosen resort of mine <\s>
<s> the brook fell down a sloping rock so as to make a waterfall considerable for that country and across the pool below had fallen a tree an ash if i rightly remember from which rose perpendicularly boughs in search of the light intercepted by the deep shade above <\s>
<s> the boughs bore leaves of green that for want of sunshine had faded into almost lily white and from the underside of this natural sylvan bridge depended long and beautiful tresses of ivy which waved gently in the breeze that might poetically speaking be called the breath of the waterfall <\s>
<s> this motion varied of course in proportion to the power of water in the brook <\s>
<s> when with dear friends i revisited this spot after an interval of more than forty years this interesting feature of the scene was gone <\s>
<s> to the owner of the place i could not but regret that the beauty of this retired part of the grounds had not tempted him to make it more accessible by a path not broad or obtrusive but sufficient for persons who love such scenes to creep along without difficulty <\s>
<s> the principal features are taken from that of my friend robert jones <\s>
<s> v composed in front of alfoxden house <\s>
<s> my little boy messenger on this occasion was the son of basil montagu <\s>
<s> the larch mentioned in the first stanza was standing when i revisited the place in may 1841 more than forty years after <\s>
<s> i was disappointed that it had not improved in appearance as to size nor had it acquired anything of the majesty of age which even though less perhaps than any other tree the larch sometimes does <\s>
<s> a few score yards from this tree grew when we inhabited alfoxden one of the most remarkable beech trees ever seen <\s>
<s> the ground sloped both towards and from it <\s>
<s> it was of immense size and threw out arms that struck into the soil like those of the banyan tree and rose again from it <\s>
<s> two of the branches thus inserted themselves twice which gave to each the appearance of a serpent moving along by gathering itself up in folds <\s>
<s> one of the large boughs of this tree had been torn off by the wind before we left alfoxden but five remained <\s>
<s> in 1841 we could barely find the spot where the tree had stood <\s>
<s> so remarkable a production of nature could not have been wilfully destroyed <\s>
<s> simon lee the old huntsman <\s>
<s> vi this old man had been huntsman to the squires of alfoxden which at the time we occupied it belonged to a minor <\s>
<s> the old man's cottage stood upon the common a little way from the entrance to alfoxden park <\s>
<s> but in 1841 it had disappeared <\s>
<s> many other changes had taken place in the adjoining village which i could not but notice with a regret more natural than well considered <\s>
<s> improvements but rarely appear such to those who after long intervals of time revisit places they have had much pleasure in <\s>
<s> it is unnecessary to add the fact was as mentioned in the poem and i have after an interval of forty five years the image of the old man as fresh before my eyes as if i had seen him yesterday <\s>
<s> the expression when the hounds were out i dearly love their voice was word for word from his own lips <\s>
<s> lines written in germany <\s>
<s> vii a plague c <\s>
<s> a bitter winter it was when these verses were composed by the side of my sister in our lodgings at a draper's house in the romantic imperial town of goslar on the edge of the hartz forest <\s>
<s> in this town the german emperors of the franconian line were accustomed to keep their court and it retains vestiges of ancient splendour <\s>
<s> so severe was the cold of this winter that when we passed out of the parlour warmed by the stove our cheeks were struck by the air as by cold iron <\s>
<s> i slept in a room over a passage that was not ceiled <\s>
<s> the people of the house used to say rather unfeelingly that they expected i should be frozen to death some night but with the protection of a pelisse lined with fur and a dog's skin bonnet such as was worn by the peasants i walked daily on the ramparts or on a sort of public ground or garden in which was a pond <\s>
<s> here i had no companion but a kingfisher a beautiful creature that used to glance by me <\s>
<s> i consequently became much attached to it <\s>
<s> during these walks i composed the poem that follows the poet's epitaph <\s>
<s> foot note the reader must be apprised that the stoves in north germany generally have the impression of a gallopping horse upon them this being part of the brunswick arms <\s>
<s> ix this and the other poems addressed to the same flower were composed at town end grasmere during the earlier part of our residence there <\s>
<s> i have been censured for the last line but one thy function apostolical as being little less than profane <\s>
<s> how could it be thought so <\s>
<s> the word is adopted with reference to its derivation implying something sent on a mission and assuredly this little flower especially when the subject of verse may be regarded in its humble degree as administering both to moral and to spiritual purposes <\s>
<s> x in the school of hawkshead is a tablet on which are inscribed in gilt letters the names of the several persons who have been schoolmasters there since the foundation of the school with the time at which they entered upon and quitted their office <\s>
<s> opposite to one of those names the author wrote the following lines if nature c <\s>
<s> x such a tablet as is here spoken of continued to be preserved in hawkshead school though the inscriptions were not brought down to our time <\s>
<s> this and other poems connected with matthew would not gain by a literal detail of facts <\s>
<s> like the wanderer in the excursion this schoolmaster was made up of several both of his class and men of other occupations <\s>
<s> i do not ask pardon for what there is of untruth in such verses considered strictly as matters of fact <\s>
<s> it is enough if being true and consistent in spirit they move and teach in a manner not unworthy of a poet's calling <\s>
<s> xiii written at town end <\s>
<s> the last line but two stood at first better and more characteristically thus by my half kitchen and half parlour fire <\s>
<s> my sister and i were in the habit of having the teakettle in our little sitting room and we toasted the bread ourselves which reminds me of a little circumstance not unworthy of being set down among these minutiae <\s>
<s> happening both of us to be engaged a few minutes one morning when we had a young prig of a scotch lawyer to breakfast with us my dear sister with her usual simplicity put the toasting fork with a slice of bread into the hands of this edinburgh genius <\s>
