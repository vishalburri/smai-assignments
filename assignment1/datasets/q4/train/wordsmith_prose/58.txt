<s> xxv by my sister <\s>
<s> suggested to her while beside my sleeping children <\s>
<s> this was in part an overflow from the solitary's description of his own and his wife's feelings upon the decease of their children and i will venture to add for private notice solely is faithfully set forth from my wife's feelings and habits after the loss of our two children within half a year of each other <\s>

<s> the last stanza the cocks did crow and the sun did shine so cold was the foundation of the whole <\s>
<s> the words were reported to me by my dear friend thomas poole but i have since heard the same reported of other idiots <\s>
<s> let me add that this long poem was composed in the groves of alfoxden almost extempore not a word i believe being corrected though one stanza was omitted <\s>

<s> the armenian lady's love <\s>
<s> xxxiv the subject of the following poem is from the orlandus of the author's friend kenelm henry digby and the liberty is taken of inscribing it to him as an acknowledgment however unworthy of pleasure and instruction derived from his numerous and valuable writings illustrative of the piety and chivalry of the olden time <\s>

<s> poems on the naming of places <\s>
<s> by persons resident in the country and attached to rural objects many places will be found unnamed or of unknown names where little incidents must have occurred or feelings been experienced which will have given to such places a private and peculiar interest <\s>
<s> from a wish to give some sort of record to such incidents and renew the gratification of such feelings names have been given to places by the author and some of his friends and the following poems written in consequence <\s>
<s> it was an april morn c i grasmere 1800 <\s>
