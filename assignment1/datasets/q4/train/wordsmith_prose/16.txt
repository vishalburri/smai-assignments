<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>

<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>

<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>

<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>

<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>

<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>

<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>
<s> there may be pleaded also for him that want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received and to draw the right inferences from them <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>

<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>

<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>

<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>

<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>

<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>

<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>

<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>
<s> there may be pleaded also for him that want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received and to draw the right inferences from them <\s>
<s> but then these apologies for his want of fidelity are also reasons before hand for suspecting it and there are now may 18th to be added to these reasons and their confirmations in the letters themselves fresh proofs in the present state of gallicia as manifested by the late re capture of vigo and the movements of the marquis de la romana all which from sir j <\s>
<s> moore's account of the temper in that province we might have confidently pronounced impossible <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>
<s> vaughan as cited by lord castlereagh for the whole east and south of lord cochrane himself a most gallant man and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the spaniards with english sailors for catalonia in particular of lord w <\s>
<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>
<s> there may be pleaded also for him that want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received and to draw the right inferences from them <\s>
<s> but then these apologies for his want of fidelity are also reasons before hand for suspecting it and there are now may 18th to be added to these reasons and their confirmations in the letters themselves fresh proofs in the present state of gallicia as manifested by the late re capture of vigo and the movements of the marquis de la romana all which from sir j <\s>
<s> moore's account of the temper in that province we might have confidently pronounced impossible <\s>
<s> we must therefore remember that what in him were simply mis statements are now when repeated with our better information calumnies and calumnies so much the less to be excused in us as we have already in our conduct towards spain given her other and no light matter of complaint against ourselves <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>
<s> vaughan as cited by lord castlereagh for the whole east and south of lord cochrane himself a most gallant man and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the spaniards with english sailors for catalonia in particular of lord w <\s>
<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>

<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>

<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>

<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>

<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>

<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>
<s> vaughan as cited by lord castlereagh for the whole east and south of lord cochrane himself a most gallant man and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the spaniards with english sailors for catalonia in particular of lord w <\s>
<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>

<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>

<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>

<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>

<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>

<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>

<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>

<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>

<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>

<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>

<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>

<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>

<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>

<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>

<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>

<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>

<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>
<s> there may be pleaded also for him that want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received and to draw the right inferences from them <\s>
<s> but then these apologies for his want of fidelity are also reasons before hand for suspecting it and there are now may 18th to be added to these reasons and their confirmations in the letters themselves fresh proofs in the present state of gallicia as manifested by the late re capture of vigo and the movements of the marquis de la romana all which from sir j <\s>
<s> moore's account of the temper in that province we might have confidently pronounced impossible <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>
<s> vaughan as cited by lord castlereagh for the whole east and south of lord cochrane himself a most gallant man and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the spaniards with english sailors for catalonia in particular of lord w <\s>
<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>
<s> there may be pleaded also for him that want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received and to draw the right inferences from them <\s>
<s> but then these apologies for his want of fidelity are also reasons before hand for suspecting it and there are now may 18th to be added to these reasons and their confirmations in the letters themselves fresh proofs in the present state of gallicia as manifested by the late re capture of vigo and the movements of the marquis de la romana all which from sir j <\s>
<s> moore's account of the temper in that province we might have confidently pronounced impossible <\s>
<s> we must therefore remember that what in him were simply mis statements are now when repeated with our better information calumnies and calumnies so much the less to be excused in us as we have already in our conduct towards spain given her other and no light matter of complaint against ourselves <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>
<s> vaughan as cited by lord castlereagh for the whole east and south of lord cochrane himself a most gallant man and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the spaniards with english sailors for catalonia in particular of lord w <\s>
<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>

<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>

<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>

<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>

<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>

<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>
<s> vaughan as cited by lord castlereagh for the whole east and south of lord cochrane himself a most gallant man and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the spaniards with english sailors for catalonia in particular of lord w <\s>
<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>

<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>

<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>

<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>

<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>

<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>

<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>

<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>

<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>

<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>

<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>

<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>

<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>

<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>

<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>

<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>

<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>

<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>
<s> there may be pleaded also for him that want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received and to draw the right inferences from them <\s>
<s> but then these apologies for his want of fidelity are also reasons before hand for suspecting it and there are now may 18th to be added to these reasons and their confirmations in the letters themselves fresh proofs in the present state of gallicia as manifested by the late re capture of vigo and the movements of the marquis de la romana all which from sir j <\s>
<s> moore's account of the temper in that province we might have confidently pronounced impossible <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>
<s> vaughan as cited by lord castlereagh for the whole east and south of lord cochrane himself a most gallant man and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the spaniards with english sailors for catalonia in particular of lord w <\s>
<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>
<s> there may be pleaded also for him that want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received and to draw the right inferences from them <\s>
<s> but then these apologies for his want of fidelity are also reasons before hand for suspecting it and there are now may 18th to be added to these reasons and their confirmations in the letters themselves fresh proofs in the present state of gallicia as manifested by the late re capture of vigo and the movements of the marquis de la romana all which from sir j <\s>
<s> moore's account of the temper in that province we might have confidently pronounced impossible <\s>
<s> we must therefore remember that what in him were simply mis statements are now when repeated with our better information calumnies and calumnies so much the less to be excused in us as we have already in our conduct towards spain given her other and no light matter of complaint against ourselves <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>
<s> but upon whom does the blame rest <\s>
<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>
<s> vaughan as cited by lord castlereagh for the whole east and south of lord cochrane himself a most gallant man and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the spaniards with english sailors for catalonia in particular of lord w <\s>
<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>

<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
<s> blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army <\s>
<s> yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the service or in any tolerable proportion to her own strength <\s>

<s> not surely upon the people who as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to them but solely upon the government <\s>
<s> up to the time when sir j m <\s>
<s> died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nation scarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people <\s>
<s> from their jealousy of popular feeling they had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole <\s>
<s> was fully aware of this the spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to say that the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will <\s>
<s> with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate <\s>
<s> but further even though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j <\s>
<s> moore saw there may have been some failures with the people it is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three <\s>
<s> so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir j m s description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain <\s>
<s> for that therefore i must look to other authorities <\s>
<s> such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen <\s>
<s> leith and of capt <\s>
<s> pasley for biscay and asturias of mr <\s>

<s> bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reports which by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves <\s>
<s> but finally we are entitled after the actions of the spaniards to dispense with such appeals <\s>
<s> spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity <\s>
<s> what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spain under two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice <\s>
<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>

<s> first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemy let him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113,000 men with a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80,000 men and then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere ): the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8th it appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms <\s>
<s> the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia <\s>
<s> the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugal the writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither <\s>
<s> let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubdued it was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defence not as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disasters but under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them <\s>
<s> but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spain to draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa <\s>
<s> under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct <\s>
<s> in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemy as places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadiz on a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemy tumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance <\s>
<s> in this statement then of the past efforts of spain and of her present preparations for further efforts will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves <\s>
<s> the author of the above note having in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedom feels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j <\s>
<s> moore's claims upon his respect <\s>
<s> perhaps if sir j m <\s>
<s> could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewhere they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written <\s>
<s> has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence <\s>
<s> we are therefore to conclude that when sir j m <\s>
<s> pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaks not of the spanish people but of the spanish government <\s>
<s> and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity and the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it <\s>
<s> there may be pleaded also for him that want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received and to draw the right inferences from them <\s>
<s> but then these apologies for his want of fidelity are also reasons before hand for suspecting it and there are now may 18th to be added to these reasons and their confirmations in the letters themselves fresh proofs in the present state of gallicia as manifested by the late re capture of vigo and the movements of the marquis de la romana all which from sir j <\s>
<s> moore's account of the temper in that province we might have confidently pronounced impossible <\s>
<s> we must therefore remember that what in him were simply mis statements are now when repeated with our better information calumnies and calumnies so much the less to be excused in us as we have already in our conduct towards spain given her other and no light matter of complaint against ourselves <\s>

<s> my dear sir i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you <\s>
<s> before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago <\s>
<s> in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so <\s>
<s> i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun <\s>
<s> i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me <\s>
<s> i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me <\s>
<s> but enough of my trespasses <\s>
<s> let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received <\s>
<s> now for your book <\s>
<s> i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do <\s>
<s> on this account i did not see it till a few days ago <\s>
<s> i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over <\s>
<s> from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed <\s>
<s> it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes <\s>
<s> but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken <\s>
<s> these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz <\s>
<s> that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown <\s>
<s> in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed <\s>
<s> you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c <\s>
<s> that appears to make for the french <\s>
<s> this i think was unnecessary <\s>
<s> the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost <\s>
<s> i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished <\s>
<s> your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road <\s>
<s> now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds <\s>
<s> it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee <\s>
<s> in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments <\s>
<s> was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be <\s>
<s> it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year <\s>
<s> the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find <\s>
<s> but that harvest is over <\s>
<s> austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least <\s>
<s> but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained <\s>
<s> in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure <\s>
<s> their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support <\s>
<s> what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments <\s>
<s> now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations <\s>
<s> whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched <\s>
<s> you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height <\s>
<s> this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years <\s>
<s> how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms <\s>
<s> not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms <\s>
<s> if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than one sixth of our trade would perish <\s>
<s> the spirit of buonaparte's government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for gold gold <\s>
<s> and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow <\s>
<s> this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty <\s>
<s> i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce <\s>
<s> is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moment's warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed <\s>
