<s> it is obvious that persons so unsettled whatever might be their good wishes and readiness to part with money for charitable purposes would ill supply the loss of the inhabitants who had been driven away <\s>
<s> it will be felt by those who think with me upon this occasion that i have been writing on behalf of a social condition which no one who is competent to judge of it will be willing to subvert and that i have been endeavouring to support moral sentiments and intellectual pleasures of a high order against an enmity which seems growing more and more formidable every day i mean utilitarianism serving as a mask for cupidity and gambling speculations <\s>
<s> my business with this evil lies in its reckless mode of action by railways now its favourite instruments <\s>
<s> upon good authority i have been told that there was lately an intention of driving one of these pests as they are likely too often to prove through a part of the magnificent ruins of furness abbey an outrage which was prevented by some one pointing out how easily a deviation might be made and the hint produced its due effect upon the engineer <\s>
<s> sacred as that relic of the devotion of our ancestors deserves to be kept there are temples of nature temples built by the almighty which have a still higher claim to be left unviolated <\s>
<s> almost every reach of the winding vales in this district might once have presented itself to a man of imagination and feeling under that aspect or as the vale of grasmere appeared to the poet gray more than seventy years ago <\s>
<s> no flaring gentleman's house says he nor garden walls break in upon the repose of this little unsuspected paradise but all is peace c c <\s>
<s> were the poet now living how would he have lamented the probable intrusion of a railway with its scarifications its intersections its noisy machinery its smoke and swarms of pleasure hunters most of them thinking that they do not fly fast enough through the country which they have come to see <\s>
<s> even a broad highway may in some places greatly impair the characteristic beauty of the country as will be readily acknowledged by those who remember what the lake of grasmere was before the new road that runs along its eastern margin had been constructed <\s>
<s> quanto praestantias esset numen aquae viridi si margina clauderet undas herba as it once was and fringed with wood instead of the breastwork of bare wall that now confines it <\s>
<s> in the same manner has the beauty and still more the sublimity of many passes in the alps been injuriously affected <\s>
<s> will the reader excuse a quotation from a ms <\s>
<s> poem in which i attempted to describe the impression made upon my mind by the descent towards italy along the simplon before the new military road had taken the place of the old muleteer track with its primitive simplicities <\s>
<s> brook and road were fellow travellers in this gloomy pass and with them did we journey several hours at a slow step <\s>
<s> the immeasurable height of woods decaying never to be decayed the stationary blasts of waterfalls <\s>
<s> and in the narrow rent at every turn winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn the torrents shooting from the clear blue sky the rocks that muttered close upon our ears black drizzling crags that spake by the way side as if a voice were in them the sick sight and giddy prospect of the raving stream the unfettered clouds and region of the heavens tumult and peace the darkness and the light were all like workings of one mind the features of the same face blossoms upon one tree characters of the great apocalypse the types and symbols of eternity of first and last and midst and without end <\s>
<s> thirty years afterwards i crossed the alps by the same pass and what had become of the forms and powers to which i had been indebted for those emotions <\s>
<s> many of them remained of course undestroyed and indestructible <\s>
<s> but though the road and torrent continued to run parallel to each other their fellowship was put an end to <\s>
<s> the stream had dwindled into comparative insignificance so much had art interfered with and taken the lead of nature and although the utility of the new work as facilitating the intercourse of great nations was readily acquiesced in and the workmanship in some places could not but excite admiration it was impossible to suppress regret for what had vanished for ever <\s>
<s> the oratories heretofore not unfrequently met with on a road still somewhat perilous were gone the simple and rude bridges swept away and instead of travellers proceeding with leisure to observe and feel were pilgrims of fashion hurried along in their carriages not a few of them perhaps discussing the merits of the last new novel or poring over their guide books or fast asleep <\s>
<s> similar remarks might be applied to the mountainous country of wales but there too the plea of utility especially as expediting the communication between england and ireland more than justifies the labours of the engineer <\s>
<s> not so would it be with the lake district <\s>
<s> a railroad is already planned along the sea coast and another from lancaster to carlisle is in great forwardness an intermediate one is therefore to say the least of it superfluous <\s>
<s> once for all let me declare that it is not against railways but against the abuse of them that i am contending <\s>
<s> how far i am from undervaluing the benefit to be expected from railways in their legitimate application will appear from the following lines published in 1837 and composed some years earlier <\s>
<s> motions and means on sea on land at war with old poetic feeling not for this shall ye by poets even be judged amiss <\s>
<s> nor shall your presence howsoe'er it mar the loveliness of nature prove a bar to the mind's gaining that prophetic sense of future good that point of vision whence may be discovered what in soul ye are <\s>
<s> in spite of all that beauty must disown in your harsh features nature doth embrace her lawful offspring in man's art and time pleased with your triumphs o'er his brother space accepts from your bold hand the proffered crown of hope and welcomes you with cheer sublime <\s>
<s> i have now done with the subject <\s>
<s> the time of life at which i have arrived may i trust if nothing else will guard me from the imputation of having written from any selfish interests or from fear of disturbance which a railway might cause to myself <\s>
<s> if gratitude for what repose and quiet in a district hitherto for the most part not disfigured but beautified by human hands have done for me through the course of a long life and hope that others might hereafter be benefited in the same manner and in the same country be selfishness then indeed but not otherwise i plead guilty to the charge <\s>
<s> nor have i opposed this undertaking on account of the inhabitants of the district merely but as hath been intimated for the sake of every one however humble his condition who coming hither shall bring with him an eye to perceive and a heart to feel and worthily enjoy <\s>
<s> and as for holiday pastimes if a scene is to be chosen suitable to them for persons thronging from a distance it may be found elsewhere at less cost of every kind <\s>
<s> but in fact we have too much hurrying about in these islands much for idle pleasure and more from over activity in the pursuit of wealth without regard to the good or happiness of others <\s>
<s> proud were ye mountains when in times of old your patriot sons to stem invasive war intrenched your brows ye gloried in each scar now for your shame a power the thirst of gold that rules o'er britain like a baneful star wills that your peace your beauty shall be sold and clear way made for her triumphal car through the beloved retreats your arms enfold <\s>
<s> heard ye that whistle <\s>
<s> as her long linked train swept onwards did the vision cross your view <\s>
<s> yes ye were startled and in balance true weighing the mischief with the promised gain mountains and vales and floods i call on you to share the passion of a just disdain <\s>

<s> a a letter to a friend of robert burns 1816 <\s>
<s> wordsworth was justified in naming gray a friend of burns <\s>
<s> he was originally master of the high school dumfries and associated with the poet there <\s>
