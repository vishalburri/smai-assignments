<s> words are too awful an instrument for good and evil to be trifled with they hold above all other external powers a dominion over thoughts <\s>

<s> if my notions are right the epitaphs of pope cannot well be too severely condemned for not only are they almost wholly destitute of those universal feelings and simple movements of mind which we have called for as indispensible but they are little better than a tissue of false thoughts languid and vague expressions unmeaning antithesis and laborious attempts at discrimination <\s>

<s> and has acted accordingly however strenuous may have been his adherence to this principle it will be well known by those who have had an opportunity of observing him narrowly that there have been perpetual obliquities in his course evil passions thwarting each other in various ways and now and then revivals of his better nature which check him for a short time or lead him to remeasure his steps not to speak of the various necessities of counterfeiting virtue which the furtherance of his schemes will impose upon him and the division which will be consequently introduced into his nature <\s>
<s> it is reasonable then that cicero when holding up catiline to detestation and without going to such an extreme case that dryden and pope when they are describing characters like buckingham shaftsbury and the duchess of marlborough should represent qualities and actions at war with each other and with themselves and that the page should be suitably crowded with antithetical expressions <\s>
<s> but all this argues an obtuse moral sensibility and a consequent want of knowledge if applied where virtue ought to be described in the language of affectionate admiration <\s>
<s> in the mind of the truly great and good everything that is of importance is at peace with itself all is stillness sweetness and stable grandeur <\s>
<s> accordingly the contemplation of virtue is attended with repose <\s>
<s> a lovely quality if its loveliness be clearly perceived fastens the mind with absolute sovereignty upon itself permitting or inciting it to pass by smooth gradation or gentle transition to some other kindred quality <\s>
<s> thus a perfect image of meekness i refer to an instance before given when looked at by a tender mind in its happiest mood might easily lead on to thoughts of magnanimity for assuredly there is nothing incongruous in those virtues <\s>
<s> but the mind would not then be separated from the person who is the object of its thoughts it would still be confined to that person or to others of the same general character that is would be kept within the circle of qualities which range themselves quietly by each other's sides <\s>
<s> whereas when meekness and magnanimity are represented antithetically the mind is not only carried from the main object but is compelled to turn to a subject in which the quality exists divided from some other as noble its natural ally a painful feeling <\s>
<s> that checks the course of love and repels the sweet thoughts that might be settling round the person whom it was the author's wish to endear to us but for whom after this interruption we no longer care <\s>
<s> if then a man whose duty it is to praise departed excellence not without some sense of regret or sadness to do this or to be silent should upon all occasions exhibit that mode of connecting thoughts which is only natural while we are delineating vice under certain relations we may be assured that the nobler sympathies are not alive in him that he has no clear insight into the internal constitution of virtue nor has himself been soothed cheared harmonized by those outward effects which follow everywhere her goings declaring the presence of the invisible deity <\s>
<s> and though it be true that the most admirable of them must fall far short of perfection and that the majority of those whose work is commemorated upon their tomb stones must have been persons in whom good and evil were intermixed in various proportions and stood in various degrees of opposition to each other yet the reader will remember what has been said before upon that medium of love sorrow and admiration through which a departed friend is viewed how it softens down or removes these harshnesses and contradictions which moreover must be supposed never to have been grievous for there can be no true love but between the good and no epitaph ought to be written upon a bad man except for a warning <\s>

<s> if my notions are right the epitaphs of pope cannot well be too severely condemned for not only are they almost wholly destitute of those universal feelings and simple movements of mind which we have called for as indispensible but they are little better than a tissue of false thoughts languid and vague expressions unmeaning antithesis and laborious attempts at discrimination <\s>

<s> and has acted accordingly however strenuous may have been his adherence to this principle it will be well known by those who have had an opportunity of observing him narrowly that there have been perpetual obliquities in his course evil passions thwarting each other in various ways and now and then revivals of his better nature which check him for a short time or lead him to remeasure his steps not to speak of the various necessities of counterfeiting virtue which the furtherance of his schemes will impose upon him and the division which will be consequently introduced into his nature <\s>
<s> it is reasonable then that cicero when holding up catiline to detestation and without going to such an extreme case that dryden and pope when they are describing characters like buckingham shaftsbury and the duchess of marlborough should represent qualities and actions at war with each other and with themselves and that the page should be suitably crowded with antithetical expressions <\s>
<s> but all this argues an obtuse moral sensibility and a consequent want of knowledge if applied where virtue ought to be described in the language of affectionate admiration <\s>
<s> in the mind of the truly great and good everything that is of importance is at peace with itself all is stillness sweetness and stable grandeur <\s>
<s> accordingly the contemplation of virtue is attended with repose <\s>
<s> a lovely quality if its loveliness be clearly perceived fastens the mind with absolute sovereignty upon itself permitting or inciting it to pass by smooth gradation or gentle transition to some other kindred quality <\s>
<s> thus a perfect image of meekness i refer to an instance before given when looked at by a tender mind in its happiest mood might easily lead on to thoughts of magnanimity for assuredly there is nothing incongruous in those virtues <\s>
<s> but the mind would not then be separated from the person who is the object of its thoughts it would still be confined to that person or to others of the same general character that is would be kept within the circle of qualities which range themselves quietly by each other's sides <\s>
<s> whereas when meekness and magnanimity are represented antithetically the mind is not only carried from the main object but is compelled to turn to a subject in which the quality exists divided from some other as noble its natural ally a painful feeling <\s>
<s> that checks the course of love and repels the sweet thoughts that might be settling round the person whom it was the author's wish to endear to us but for whom after this interruption we no longer care <\s>
<s> if then a man whose duty it is to praise departed excellence not without some sense of regret or sadness to do this or to be silent should upon all occasions exhibit that mode of connecting thoughts which is only natural while we are delineating vice under certain relations we may be assured that the nobler sympathies are not alive in him that he has no clear insight into the internal constitution of virtue nor has himself been soothed cheared harmonized by those outward effects which follow everywhere her goings declaring the presence of the invisible deity <\s>
<s> and though it be true that the most admirable of them must fall far short of perfection and that the majority of those whose work is commemorated upon their tomb stones must have been persons in whom good and evil were intermixed in various proportions and stood in various degrees of opposition to each other yet the reader will remember what has been said before upon that medium of love sorrow and admiration through which a departed friend is viewed how it softens down or removes these harshnesses and contradictions which moreover must be supposed never to have been grievous for there can be no true love but between the good and no epitaph ought to be written upon a bad man except for a warning <\s>

<s> if my notions are right the epitaphs of pope cannot well be too severely condemned for not only are they almost wholly destitute of those universal feelings and simple movements of mind which we have called for as indispensible but they are little better than a tissue of false thoughts languid and vague expressions unmeaning antithesis and laborious attempts at discrimination <\s>

<s> and has acted accordingly however strenuous may have been his adherence to this principle it will be well known by those who have had an opportunity of observing him narrowly that there have been perpetual obliquities in his course evil passions thwarting each other in various ways and now and then revivals of his better nature which check him for a short time or lead him to remeasure his steps not to speak of the various necessities of counterfeiting virtue which the furtherance of his schemes will impose upon him and the division which will be consequently introduced into his nature <\s>
<s> it is reasonable then that cicero when holding up catiline to detestation and without going to such an extreme case that dryden and pope when they are describing characters like buckingham shaftsbury and the duchess of marlborough should represent qualities and actions at war with each other and with themselves and that the page should be suitably crowded with antithetical expressions <\s>
<s> but all this argues an obtuse moral sensibility and a consequent want of knowledge if applied where virtue ought to be described in the language of affectionate admiration <\s>
<s> in the mind of the truly great and good everything that is of importance is at peace with itself all is stillness sweetness and stable grandeur <\s>
<s> accordingly the contemplation of virtue is attended with repose <\s>
<s> a lovely quality if its loveliness be clearly perceived fastens the mind with absolute sovereignty upon itself permitting or inciting it to pass by smooth gradation or gentle transition to some other kindred quality <\s>
<s> thus a perfect image of meekness i refer to an instance before given when looked at by a tender mind in its happiest mood might easily lead on to thoughts of magnanimity for assuredly there is nothing incongruous in those virtues <\s>
<s> but the mind would not then be separated from the person who is the object of its thoughts it would still be confined to that person or to others of the same general character that is would be kept within the circle of qualities which range themselves quietly by each other's sides <\s>
<s> whereas when meekness and magnanimity are represented antithetically the mind is not only carried from the main object but is compelled to turn to a subject in which the quality exists divided from some other as noble its natural ally a painful feeling <\s>
<s> that checks the course of love and repels the sweet thoughts that might be settling round the person whom it was the author's wish to endear to us but for whom after this interruption we no longer care <\s>
<s> if then a man whose duty it is to praise departed excellence not without some sense of regret or sadness to do this or to be silent should upon all occasions exhibit that mode of connecting thoughts which is only natural while we are delineating vice under certain relations we may be assured that the nobler sympathies are not alive in him that he has no clear insight into the internal constitution of virtue nor has himself been soothed cheared harmonized by those outward effects which follow everywhere her goings declaring the presence of the invisible deity <\s>
<s> and though it be true that the most admirable of them must fall far short of perfection and that the majority of those whose work is commemorated upon their tomb stones must have been persons in whom good and evil were intermixed in various proportions and stood in various degrees of opposition to each other yet the reader will remember what has been said before upon that medium of love sorrow and admiration through which a departed friend is viewed how it softens down or removes these harshnesses and contradictions which moreover must be supposed never to have been grievous for there can be no true love but between the good and no epitaph ought to be written upon a bad man except for a warning <\s>

<s> if my notions are right the epitaphs of pope cannot well be too severely condemned for not only are they almost wholly destitute of those universal feelings and simple movements of mind which we have called for as indispensible but they are little better than a tissue of false thoughts languid and vague expressions unmeaning antithesis and laborious attempts at discrimination <\s>

<s> and has acted accordingly however strenuous may have been his adherence to this principle it will be well known by those who have had an opportunity of observing him narrowly that there have been perpetual obliquities in his course evil passions thwarting each other in various ways and now and then revivals of his better nature which check him for a short time or lead him to remeasure his steps not to speak of the various necessities of counterfeiting virtue which the furtherance of his schemes will impose upon him and the division which will be consequently introduced into his nature <\s>
<s> it is reasonable then that cicero when holding up catiline to detestation and without going to such an extreme case that dryden and pope when they are describing characters like buckingham shaftsbury and the duchess of marlborough should represent qualities and actions at war with each other and with themselves and that the page should be suitably crowded with antithetical expressions <\s>
<s> but all this argues an obtuse moral sensibility and a consequent want of knowledge if applied where virtue ought to be described in the language of affectionate admiration <\s>
<s> in the mind of the truly great and good everything that is of importance is at peace with itself all is stillness sweetness and stable grandeur <\s>
<s> accordingly the contemplation of virtue is attended with repose <\s>
<s> a lovely quality if its loveliness be clearly perceived fastens the mind with absolute sovereignty upon itself permitting or inciting it to pass by smooth gradation or gentle transition to some other kindred quality <\s>
<s> thus a perfect image of meekness i refer to an instance before given when looked at by a tender mind in its happiest mood might easily lead on to thoughts of magnanimity for assuredly there is nothing incongruous in those virtues <\s>
<s> but the mind would not then be separated from the person who is the object of its thoughts it would still be confined to that person or to others of the same general character that is would be kept within the circle of qualities which range themselves quietly by each other's sides <\s>
<s> whereas when meekness and magnanimity are represented antithetically the mind is not only carried from the main object but is compelled to turn to a subject in which the quality exists divided from some other as noble its natural ally a painful feeling <\s>
<s> that checks the course of love and repels the sweet thoughts that might be settling round the person whom it was the author's wish to endear to us but for whom after this interruption we no longer care <\s>
<s> if then a man whose duty it is to praise departed excellence not without some sense of regret or sadness to do this or to be silent should upon all occasions exhibit that mode of connecting thoughts which is only natural while we are delineating vice under certain relations we may be assured that the nobler sympathies are not alive in him that he has no clear insight into the internal constitution of virtue nor has himself been soothed cheared harmonized by those outward effects which follow everywhere her goings declaring the presence of the invisible deity <\s>
<s> and though it be true that the most admirable of them must fall far short of perfection and that the majority of those whose work is commemorated upon their tomb stones must have been persons in whom good and evil were intermixed in various proportions and stood in various degrees of opposition to each other yet the reader will remember what has been said before upon that medium of love sorrow and admiration through which a departed friend is viewed how it softens down or removes these harshnesses and contradictions which moreover must be supposed never to have been grievous for there can be no true love but between the good and no epitaph ought to be written upon a bad man except for a warning <\s>

<s> if my notions are right the epitaphs of pope cannot well be too severely condemned for not only are they almost wholly destitute of those universal feelings and simple movements of mind which we have called for as indispensible but they are little better than a tissue of false thoughts languid and vague expressions unmeaning antithesis and laborious attempts at discrimination <\s>

<s> and has acted accordingly however strenuous may have been his adherence to this principle it will be well known by those who have had an opportunity of observing him narrowly that there have been perpetual obliquities in his course evil passions thwarting each other in various ways and now and then revivals of his better nature which check him for a short time or lead him to remeasure his steps not to speak of the various necessities of counterfeiting virtue which the furtherance of his schemes will impose upon him and the division which will be consequently introduced into his nature <\s>
<s> it is reasonable then that cicero when holding up catiline to detestation and without going to such an extreme case that dryden and pope when they are describing characters like buckingham shaftsbury and the duchess of marlborough should represent qualities and actions at war with each other and with themselves and that the page should be suitably crowded with antithetical expressions <\s>
<s> but all this argues an obtuse moral sensibility and a consequent want of knowledge if applied where virtue ought to be described in the language of affectionate admiration <\s>
<s> in the mind of the truly great and good everything that is of importance is at peace with itself all is stillness sweetness and stable grandeur <\s>
<s> accordingly the contemplation of virtue is attended with repose <\s>
<s> a lovely quality if its loveliness be clearly perceived fastens the mind with absolute sovereignty upon itself permitting or inciting it to pass by smooth gradation or gentle transition to some other kindred quality <\s>
<s> thus a perfect image of meekness i refer to an instance before given when looked at by a tender mind in its happiest mood might easily lead on to thoughts of magnanimity for assuredly there is nothing incongruous in those virtues <\s>
<s> but the mind would not then be separated from the person who is the object of its thoughts it would still be confined to that person or to others of the same general character that is would be kept within the circle of qualities which range themselves quietly by each other's sides <\s>
<s> whereas when meekness and magnanimity are represented antithetically the mind is not only carried from the main object but is compelled to turn to a subject in which the quality exists divided from some other as noble its natural ally a painful feeling <\s>
<s> that checks the course of love and repels the sweet thoughts that might be settling round the person whom it was the author's wish to endear to us but for whom after this interruption we no longer care <\s>
<s> if then a man whose duty it is to praise departed excellence not without some sense of regret or sadness to do this or to be silent should upon all occasions exhibit that mode of connecting thoughts which is only natural while we are delineating vice under certain relations we may be assured that the nobler sympathies are not alive in him that he has no clear insight into the internal constitution of virtue nor has himself been soothed cheared harmonized by those outward effects which follow everywhere her goings declaring the presence of the invisible deity <\s>
<s> and though it be true that the most admirable of them must fall far short of perfection and that the majority of those whose work is commemorated upon their tomb stones must have been persons in whom good and evil were intermixed in various proportions and stood in various degrees of opposition to each other yet the reader will remember what has been said before upon that medium of love sorrow and admiration through which a departed friend is viewed how it softens down or removes these harshnesses and contradictions which moreover must be supposed never to have been grievous for there can be no true love but between the good and no epitaph ought to be written upon a bad man except for a warning <\s>

<s> johnson having extolled it highly and pronounced it the best of the collection <\s>
<s> here rests a woman good without pretence blest with plain reason and with sober sense no conquest she but o'er herself desir'd no arts essayed but not to be admir'd <\s>
<s> passion and pride were to her soul unknown convinc'd that virtue only is our own <\s>
<s> so unaffected so compos'd a mind so firm yet soft so strong yet so refin'd heaven as its purest gold by tortures tried the saint sustain'd it but the woman died <\s>
<s> this may be the best of pope's epitaphs but if the standard which we have fixed be a just one it cannot be approved of <\s>
<s> first it must be observed that in the epitaphs of this writer the true impulse is wanting and that his motions must of necessity be feeble <\s>
<s> for he has no other aim than to give a favourable portrait of the character of the deceased <\s>
<s> now mark the process by which this is performed <\s>
<s> nothing is represented implicitly that is with its accompaniment of circumstances or conveyed by its effects <\s>
<s> the author forgets that it is a living creature that must interest us and not an intellectual existence which a mere character is <\s>
<s> insensible to this distinction the brain of the writer is set at work to report as flatteringly as he may of the mind of his subject the good qualities are separately abstracted can it be otherwise than coldly and unfeelingly and put together again as coldly and unfeelingly <\s>
<s> the epitaph now before us owes what exemption it may have from these defects in its general plan to the excruciating disease of which the lady died but it is liable to the same censure and is like the rest further objectionable in this namely that the thoughts have their nature changed and moulded by the vicious expression in which they are entangled to an excess rendering them wholly unfit for the place they occupy <\s>
<s> here rests a woman good without pretence blest with plain reason from which sober sense is not sufficiently distinguishable <\s>
<s> this verse and a half and the one so unaffected so composed a mind are characteristic and the expression is true to nature but they are if i may take the liberty of saying it the only parts of the epitaph which have this merit <\s>
<s> minute criticism is in its nature irksome and as commonly practiced in books and conversation is both irksome and injurious <\s>
<s> yet every mind must occasionally be exercised in this discipline else it cannot learn the art of bringing words rigorously to the test of thoughts and these again to a comparison with things their archetypes contemplated first in themselves and secondly in relation to each other in all which processes the mind must be skilful otherwise it will be perpetually imposed upon <\s>
<s> in the next couplet the word conquest is applied in a manner that would have been displeasing even from its triteness in a copy of complimentary verses to a fashionable beauty but to talk of making conquests in an epitaph is not to be endured <\s>
<s> no arts essayed but not to be admired are words expressing that she had recourse to artifices to conceal her amiable and admirable qualities and the context implies that there was a merit in this which surely no sane mind would allow <\s>
<s> but the meaning of the author simply and honestly given was nothing more than that she shunned admiration probably with a more apprehensive modesty than was common and more than this would have been inconsistent with the praise bestowed upon her that she had an unaffected mind <\s>
<s> this couplet is further objectionable because the sense of love and peaceful admiration which such a character naturally inspires is disturbed by an oblique and ill timed stroke of satire <\s>
<s> she is not praised so much as others are blamed and is degraded by the author in thus being made a covert or stalking horse for gratifying a propensity the most abhorrent from her own nature 'passion and pride were to her soul unknown <\s>
<s> it cannot be meant that she had no passions but that they were moderate and kept in subordination to her reason but the thought is not here expressed nor is it clear that a conviction in the understanding that virtue only is our own though it might suppress her pride would be itself competent to govern or abate many other affections and passions to which our frail nature is and ought in various degrees to be subject <\s>
<s> in fact the author appears to have had no precise notion of his own meaning <\s>
<s> if she was good without pretence it seems unnecessary to say that she was not proud <\s>
<s> johnson making an exception of the verse convinced that virtue only is our own praises this epitaph for containing nothing taken from common places <\s>
<s> now in fact as may be deduced from the principles of this discourse it is not only no fault but a primary requisite in an epitaph that it shall contain thoughts and feelings which are in their substance common place and even trite <\s>
<s> it is grounded upon the universal intellectual property of man sensations which all men have felt and feel in some degree daily and hourly truths whose very interest and importance have caused them to be unattended to as things which could take care of themselves <\s>
<s> but it is required that these truths should be instinctively ejaculated or should rise irresistibly from circumstances in a word that they should be uttered in such connection as shall make it felt that they are not adopted not spoken by rote but perceived in their whole compass with the freshness and clearness of an original intuition <\s>
<s> the writer must introduce the truth with such accompaniment as shall imply that he has mounted to the sources of things penetrated the dark cavern from which the river that murmurs in every one's ear has flowed from generation to generation <\s>
<s> the line virtue only is our own is objectionable not from the common placeness of the truth but from the vapid manner in which it is conveyed <\s>
<s> a similar sentiment is expressed with appropriate dignity in an epitaph by chiabrera where he makes the archbishop of albino say of himself that he was smitten by the great ones of the world but did not fall for virtue braves all shocks upon herself resting immoveably <\s>
<s> so firm yet soft so strong yet so refined these intellectual operations while they can be conceived of as operations of intellect at all for in fact one half of the process is mechanical words doing their own work and one half of the line manufacturing the rest remind me of the motions of a posture master or of a man balancing a sword upon his finger which must be kept from falling at all hazards <\s>
<s> the saint sustained it but the woman died <\s>
<s> let us look steadily at this antithesis the saint that is her soul strengthened by religion supported the anguish of her disease with patience and resignation but the woman that is her body for if anything else is meant by the word woman it contradicts the former part of the proposition and the passage is nonsense was overcome <\s>
<s> why was not this simply expressed without playing with the reader's fancy to the delusion and dishonour of his understanding by a trifling epigramatic point <\s>
<s> ages must pass away before men will have their eyes open to the beauty and majesty of truth and will be taught to venerate poetry no further than as she is a handmaid pure as her mistress the noblest handmaid in her train <\s>
<s> c celebrated epitaphs considered <\s>
<s> from the author's mss <\s>
<s> i vindicate the rights and dignity of nature and as long as i condemn nothing without assigning reasons not lightly given i cannot suffer any individual however highly and deservedly honoured by my countrymen to stand in my way <\s>
<s> if my notions are right the epitaphs of pope cannot well be too severely condemned for not only are they almost wholly destitute of those universal feelings and simple movements of mind which we have called for as indispensible but they are little better than a tissue of false thoughts languid and vague expressions unmeaning antithesis and laborious attempts at discrimination <\s>
<s> pope's mind had been employed chiefly in observation upon the vices and follies of men <\s>
<s> now vice and folly are in contradiction with the moral principle which can never be extinguished in the mind and therefore wanting the contrast are irregular capricious and inconsistent with themselves <\s>
<s> if a man has once said see friend no ...... evil be thou my good <\s>
<s> and has acted accordingly however strenuous may have been his adherence to this principle it will be well known by those who have had an opportunity of observing him narrowly that there have been perpetual obliquities in his course evil passions thwarting each other in various ways and now and then revivals of his better nature which check him for a short time or lead him to remeasure his steps not to speak of the various necessities of counterfeiting virtue which the furtherance of his schemes will impose upon him and the division which will be consequently introduced into his nature <\s>
<s> it is reasonable then that cicero when holding up catiline to detestation and without going to such an extreme case that dryden and pope when they are describing characters like buckingham shaftsbury and the duchess of marlborough should represent qualities and actions at war with each other and with themselves and that the page should be suitably crowded with antithetical expressions <\s>
<s> but all this argues an obtuse moral sensibility and a consequent want of knowledge if applied where virtue ought to be described in the language of affectionate admiration <\s>
<s> in the mind of the truly great and good everything that is of importance is at peace with itself all is stillness sweetness and stable grandeur <\s>
<s> accordingly the contemplation of virtue is attended with repose <\s>
<s> a lovely quality if its loveliness be clearly perceived fastens the mind with absolute sovereignty upon itself permitting or inciting it to pass by smooth gradation or gentle transition to some other kindred quality <\s>
<s> thus a perfect image of meekness i refer to an instance before given when looked at by a tender mind in its happiest mood might easily lead on to thoughts of magnanimity for assuredly there is nothing incongruous in those virtues <\s>
<s> but the mind would not then be separated from the person who is the object of its thoughts it would still be confined to that person or to others of the same general character that is would be kept within the circle of qualities which range themselves quietly by each other's sides <\s>
<s> whereas when meekness and magnanimity are represented antithetically the mind is not only carried from the main object but is compelled to turn to a subject in which the quality exists divided from some other as noble its natural ally a painful feeling <\s>
<s> that checks the course of love and repels the sweet thoughts that might be settling round the person whom it was the author's wish to endear to us but for whom after this interruption we no longer care <\s>
<s> if then a man whose duty it is to praise departed excellence not without some sense of regret or sadness to do this or to be silent should upon all occasions exhibit that mode of connecting thoughts which is only natural while we are delineating vice under certain relations we may be assured that the nobler sympathies are not alive in him that he has no clear insight into the internal constitution of virtue nor has himself been soothed cheared harmonized by those outward effects which follow everywhere her goings declaring the presence of the invisible deity <\s>
<s> and though it be true that the most admirable of them must fall far short of perfection and that the majority of those whose work is commemorated upon their tomb stones must have been persons in whom good and evil were intermixed in various proportions and stood in various degrees of opposition to each other yet the reader will remember what has been said before upon that medium of love sorrow and admiration through which a departed friend is viewed how it softens down or removes these harshnesses and contradictions which moreover must be supposed never to have been grievous for there can be no true love but between the good and no epitaph ought to be written upon a bad man except for a warning <\s>
<s> the purpose of the remarks given in the last essay was chiefly to assist the reader in separating truth and sincerity from falsehood and affectation presuming that if the unction of a devout heart be wanting everything else is of no avail <\s>
<s> it was shewn that a current of just thought and feeling may flow under a surface of illustrative imagery so impure as to produce an effect the opposite of that which was intended <\s>
<s> yet though this fault may be carried to an intolerable degree the reader will have gathered that in our estimation it is not in kind the most offensive and injurious <\s>
<s> we have contrasted it in its excess with instances where the genuine current or vein was wholly wanting where the thoughts and feelings had no vital union but were artificially connected or formally accumulated in a manner that would imply discontinuity and feebleness of mind upon any occasion but still more reprehensible here <\s>
<s> i will proceed to give milder examples not in this last kind but in the former namely of failure from various causes where the ground work is good <\s>
<s> all that my soul holds dear take that best gift which heaven so lately gave to bristol's fount i bore with trembling care her faded form <\s>
<s> she bow'd to taste the wave and died <\s>
<s> does youth does beauty read the line <\s>
<s> does sympathetic fear their breasts alarm <\s>
<s> breathe a strain divine even from the grave thou shalt have power to charm <\s>
<s> bid them in duty's sphere as meekly move and if so fair from vanity as free as firm in friendship and as fond in love tell them tho tis an awful thing to die twas e'en to thee yet the dread path once trod heaven lifts its everlasting portals high and bids the pure in heart behold their god <\s>
<s> this epitaph has much of what we have demanded but it is debased in some instances by weakness of expression in others by false prettiness <\s>
<s> she bow'd to taste the wave and died <\s>
<s> the plain truth was she drank the bristol waters which failed to restore her and her death soon followed but the expression involves a multitude of petty occupations for the fancy <\s>
<s> she bow'd was there any truth in this <\s>
<s> to taste the wave the water of a mineral spring which must have been drunk out of a goblet <\s>
<s> strange application of the word wave and died this would have been a just expression if the water had killed her but as it is the tender thought involved in the disappointment of a hope however faint is left unexpressed and a shock of surprise is given entertaining perhaps to a light fancy but to a steady mind unsatisfactory because false <\s>
<s> dead maria breathe a strain divine <\s>
<s> this sense flows nobly from the heart and the imagination but perhaps it is not one of those impassioned thoughts which should be fixed in language upon a sepulchral stone <\s>
<s> it is in its nature too poignant and transitory <\s>
<s> a husband meditating by his wife's grave would throw off such a feeling and would give voice to it and it would be in its place in a monody to her memory but if i am not mistaken ought to have been suppressed here or uttered after a different manner <\s>
<s> the implied impersonation of the deceased according to the tenor of what has before been said ought to have been more general and shadowy <\s>
<s> and if so fair from vanity as free as firm in friendship and as fond in love tell them these are two sweet verses but the word fair is improper for unquestionably it was not intended that their title to receive this assurance should depend at all upon their personal beauty <\s>
<s> moreover in this couplet and in what follows the long suspension of the sense excites the expectation of a thought less common than the concluding one and is an instance of a failure in doing what is most needful and most difficult in an epitaph to do; namely to give to universally received truths a pathos and spirit which shall re admit them into the soul like revelations of the moment <\s>
<s> i have said that this excellence is difficult to attain and why <\s>
<s> is it because nature is weak <\s>
<s> where the soul has been thoroughly stricken and heaven knows the course of life must have placed all men at some time or other in that condition there is never a want of positive strength but because the adversary of nature call that adversary art or by what name you will is comparatively strong <\s>
<s> the far searching influence of the power which for want of a better name we will denominate taste is in nothing more evinced than in the changeful character and complexion of that species of composition which we have been reviewing <\s>
<s> upon a call so urgent it might be expected that the affections the memory and the imagination would be constrained to speak their genuine language <\s>
<s> yet if the few specimens which have been given in the course of this enquiry do not demonstrate the fact the reader need only look into any collection of epitaphs to be convinced that the faults predominant in the literature of every age will be as strongly reflected in the sepulchral inscriptions as any where nay perhaps more so from the anxiety of the author to do justice to the occasion and especially if the composition be in verse for then it comes more avowedly in the shape of a work of art and of course is more likely to be coloured by the work of art holden in most esteem at the time <\s>
<s> in a bulky volume of poetry entitled elegant extracts in verse which must be known to most of my readers as it is circulated everywhere and in fact constitutes at this day the poetical library of our schools i find a number of epitaphs in verse of the last century and there is scarcely one which is not thoroughly tainted by the artifices which have over run our writings in metre since the days of dryden and pope <\s>
<s> energy stillness grandeur tenderness those feelings which are the pure emanations of nature those thoughts which have the infinitude of truth and those expressions which are not what the garb is to the body but what the body is to the soul themselves a constituent part and power or function in the thought all these are abandoned for their opposites as if our countrymen through successive generations had lost the sense of solemnity and pensiveness not to speak of deeper emotions and resorted to the tombs of their forefathers and contemporaries only to be tickled and surprised <\s>
<s> would we not recoil from such gratification in such a place if the general literature of the country had not co operated with other causes insidiously to weaken our sensibilities and deprave our judgments <\s>
<s> doubtless there are shocks of event and circumstance public and private by which for all minds the truths of nature will be elicited but sorrow for that individual or people to whom these special interferences are necessary to bring them into communion with the inner spirit of things <\s>
<s> for such intercourse must be profitless in proportion as it is unfrequently irregular and transient <\s>
<s> words are too awful an instrument for good and evil to be trifled with they hold above all other external powers a dominion over thoughts <\s>
<s> if words be not recurring to a metaphor before used an incarnation of the thought but only a clothing for it then surely will they prove an ill gift such a one as those possessed vestments read of in the stories of superstitious times which had power to consume and to alienate from his right mind the victim who put them on <\s>
<s> language if it do not uphold and feed and leave in quiet like the power of gravitation or the air we breathe is a counter spirit unremittingly and noiselessly at work to subvert to lay waste to vitiate and to dissolve <\s>
<s> from a deep conviction then that the excellence of writing whether in prose or verse consists in a conjunction of reason and passion a conjunction which must be of necessity benign and that it might be deduced from what has been said that the taste intellectual power and morals of a country are inseparably linked in mutual dependence i have dwelt thus long upon this argument <\s>
<s> and the occasion justifies me for how could the tyranny of bad taste be brought home to the mind more aptly than by showing in what degree the feelings of nature yield to it when we are rendering to our friends the solemn testimony of our love <\s>
<s> more forcibly than by giving proof that thoughts cannot even upon this impulse assume an outward life without a transmutation and a fall <\s>
