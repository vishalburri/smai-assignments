<s> my lord you did me the honour of expressing a wish to hear from me during my continental tour accordingly i have great pleasure in writing from this place where we arrived three days ago <\s>
<s> our route has lain through brussels namur along the banks of the meuse to liege thence to aix la chapelle cologne and along the rhine to mayence to frankfort heidelberg a noble situation at the point where the neckar issues from steep lofty hills into the plain of the rhine carlsruhe and through the black forest to schaffhausen thence to zurich berne thun interlachen <\s>
<s> here our alpine tour might be said to commence which has produced much pleasure thus far and nothing that deserves the name of difficulty even for the ladies <\s>
<s> from the valley of lauterbrunnen we crossed the wengern alp to grindelwald and then over the grand sheideck to meyringen <\s>
<s> this journey led us over high ground and for fifteen leagues along the base of the loftiest alps which reared their bare or snow clad ridges and pikes in a clear atmosphere with fleecy clouds now and then settling upon and gathering round them <\s>
<s> we heard and saw several avalanches they are announced by a sound like thunder but more metallic and musical <\s>
<s> this warning naturally makes one look about and we had the gratification of seeing one falling in the shape and appearance of a torrent or cascade of foaming water down the deep worn crevices of the steep or perpendicular granite mountains <\s>
<s> nothing can be more awful than the sound of these cataracts of ice and snow thus descending unless it be the silence which succeeds <\s>
<s> the elevations from which we beheld these operations of nature and saw such an immense range of primitive mountains stretching to the east and west were covered with rich pasturage and beautiful flowers among which was abundance of the monkshood a flower which i had never seen but in the trim borders of our gardens and which here grew not so much in patches as in little woods or forests towering above the other plants <\s>
<s> at this season the herdsmen are with their cattle in still higher regions than those which we have trod the herbage where we travelled being reserved till they descend in the autumn <\s>
<s> we have visited the abbey of engelberg not many leagues from the borders of the lake of lucerne <\s>
<s> the tradition is that the site of the abbey was appointed by angels singing from a lofty mountain that rises from the plain of the valley and which from having been thus honoured is called engelberg or the hill of the angels <\s>
<s> it is a glorious position for such beings and i should have thought myself repaid for the trouble of so long a journey by the impression made upon my mind when i first came in view of the vale in which the convent is placed and of the mountains that enclose it <\s>

<s> to day we quit this place to ascend the mountain righi <\s>
<s> we shall be detained in this neighbourhood till our passports are returned from berne signed by the austrian minister which we find absolutely necessary to enable us to proceed into the milanese <\s>

<s> tour on the continent 1820 <\s>
<s> letters to the earl of lonsdale <\s>
<s> my lord you did me the honour of expressing a wish to hear from me during my continental tour accordingly i have great pleasure in writing from this place where we arrived three days ago <\s>
<s> our route has lain through brussels namur along the banks of the meuse to liege thence to aix la chapelle cologne and along the rhine to mayence to frankfort heidelberg a noble situation at the point where the neckar issues from steep lofty hills into the plain of the rhine carlsruhe and through the black forest to schaffhausen thence to zurich berne thun interlachen <\s>
<s> here our alpine tour might be said to commence which has produced much pleasure thus far and nothing that deserves the name of difficulty even for the ladies <\s>
<s> from the valley of lauterbrunnen we crossed the wengern alp to grindelwald and then over the grand sheideck to meyringen <\s>
<s> this journey led us over high ground and for fifteen leagues along the base of the loftiest alps which reared their bare or snow clad ridges and pikes in a clear atmosphere with fleecy clouds now and then settling upon and gathering round them <\s>
<s> we heard and saw several avalanches they are announced by a sound like thunder but more metallic and musical <\s>
<s> this warning naturally makes one look about and we had the gratification of seeing one falling in the shape and appearance of a torrent or cascade of foaming water down the deep worn crevices of the steep or perpendicular granite mountains <\s>
<s> nothing can be more awful than the sound of these cataracts of ice and snow thus descending unless it be the silence which succeeds <\s>
<s> the elevations from which we beheld these operations of nature and saw such an immense range of primitive mountains stretching to the east and west were covered with rich pasturage and beautiful flowers among which was abundance of the monkshood a flower which i had never seen but in the trim borders of our gardens and which here grew not so much in patches as in little woods or forests towering above the other plants <\s>
<s> at this season the herdsmen are with their cattle in still higher regions than those which we have trod the herbage where we travelled being reserved till they descend in the autumn <\s>
<s> we have visited the abbey of engelberg not many leagues from the borders of the lake of lucerne <\s>
<s> the tradition is that the site of the abbey was appointed by angels singing from a lofty mountain that rises from the plain of the valley and which from having been thus honoured is called engelberg or the hill of the angels <\s>
<s> it is a glorious position for such beings and i should have thought myself repaid for the trouble of so long a journey by the impression made upon my mind when i first came in view of the vale in which the convent is placed and of the mountains that enclose it <\s>
<s> the light of the sun had left the valley and the deep shadows spread over it heightened the splendour of the evening light and spread upon the surrounding mountains some of which had their summits covered with pure snow others were half hidden by vapours rolling round them and the rock of engelberg could not have been seen under more fortunate circumstances for masses of cloud glowing with the reflection of the rays of the setting sun were hovering round it like choirs of spirits preparing to settle upon its venerable head <\s>
<s> to day we quit this place to ascend the mountain righi <\s>
<s> we shall be detained in this neighbourhood till our passports are returned from berne signed by the austrian minister which we find absolutely necessary to enable us to proceed into the milanese <\s>
