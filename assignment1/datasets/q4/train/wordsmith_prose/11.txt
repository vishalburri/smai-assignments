<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>

<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>

<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>

<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>

<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>

<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>

<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>

<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>

<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>

<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>

<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>

<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>

<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>

<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>

<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>

<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>

<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>

<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>

<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>

<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>

<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>

<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>

<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>

<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>

<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>

<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>

<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>

<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>

<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>

<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>

<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>

<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>

<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>

<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>

<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>

<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>

<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>

<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>

<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>

<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>

<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>

<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>

<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>

<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>

<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>

<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>

<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>

<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>

<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>

<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>

<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>

<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>

<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>

<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>

<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>

<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>

<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>

<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>

<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>

<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>

<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>

<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>
<s> besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in pieces the unsettled prey of two rival claimants <\s>
<s> you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillity and possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair <\s>
<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>

<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>

<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>

<s> scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into self reproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicity proclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another <\s>
<s> if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous <\s>
<s> if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it <\s>

<s> no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances <\s>
<s> so much for the choice of evils <\s>
<s> but for the hope of good what is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen <\s>
<s> they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us <\s>
<s> whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against it certain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outrages moreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent <\s>
<s> for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness <\s>
<s> but the portugueze are a brave people a people of great courage and worth <\s>
<s> conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe <\s>
<s> in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seen is itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory <\s>
<s> which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit <\s>
<s> this they must have felt that they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which is and will be through all ages their due <\s>
<s> at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation <\s>
<s> for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people <\s>
<s> our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to us salutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entrance and promising for the future condition of the human race <\s>
<s> we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing genius their wisdom and knowledge of human nature have circulated and made familiar divinely tempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials <\s>
<s> by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellow feeling <\s>
<s> therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemies unexceptionable judges more competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous <\s>
<s> we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions <\s>
<s> every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes <\s>
<s> strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own <\s>
<s> a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidence not perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them <\s>
<s> these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful <\s>
<s> if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis <\s>
<s> their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them <\s>
<s> but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were just that they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create <\s>
<s> again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contending immediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue <\s>
<s> now liberty healthy matured time honoured liberty this is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence <\s>
<s> judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their hearts as an image of their understandings <\s>
<s> but it did not speak their sense it was not endured it was not submitted to in their hearts <\s>
<s> bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenant overwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future <\s>
<s> among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admit that the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral world a solitary straggler out of the circumference of nature's law a monster which could not propagate and had no birth right in futurity <\s>
<s> accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding <\s>
<s> for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was self destroying from the beginning <\s>
<s> it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations <\s>
<s> one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people <\s>
<s> therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so <\s>
<s> it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it <\s>
<s> moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence <\s>
<s> the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasure to have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had done no accessaries in their crime <\s>
<s> the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen ); but for this reason that a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest <\s>
<s> these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing <\s>
<s> no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory <\s>
<s> the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described <\s>
<s> it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable life with power to generate and transmit after its kind <\s>
<s> a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimated which declared that the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very council seat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril <\s>
<s> rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen <\s>
<s> his majesty's ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves <\s>
<s> yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time <\s>
<s> and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled <\s>
<s> there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worse ten thousand times the worse was fixed upon <\s>
<s> the ministers having thus officially applauded the treaty and by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transaction drew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country <\s>
<s> it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselves if the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour <\s>
<s> how then is this most effectually to be prevented <\s>
<s> by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself <\s>
<s> for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudly partly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligations the convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the super inducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be included in one sweeping exculpation the misdeeds of the servant and the master <\s>
<s> but whether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted upon there can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majesty's high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction <\s>
<s> in their petition they styled it also an afflicting event humiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majesty's allies <\s>
<s> and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation <\s>
<s> upon this charge as re echoed in its general import by persons who have been over awed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation <\s>
<s> i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereign's authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation <\s>
<s> in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes <\s>
<s> if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questions what is the act <\s>
<s> and who is the agent or to both conjointly <\s>
<s> now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but who it does not take upon itself to say <\s>
<s> it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more <\s>
<s> after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionate as it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land <\s>
<s> it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can be a privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correction not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty <\s>
<s> nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governments from the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler <\s>
<s> it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it is to express and to act upon their own individual will <\s>
<s> tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity <\s>
<s> it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of morocco see appendix d to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do <\s>
<s> why then have historians written <\s>
<s> and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or loving approving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes <\s>
<s> but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd <\s>
<s> for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment <\s>
<s> therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and front' the life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate <\s>
<s> and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of milton's chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific mace and bound with gorgonian rigour by the look' of despotism is transmuted and becomes a high way of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation <\s>
<s> again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present <\s>
<s> if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court <\s>
<s> what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated <\s>
<s> if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to exist except in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and ear witnesses are few how much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole world now it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majesty's throne and they have been reproached by his majesty's ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistrate makes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and self delusion on the part of those who framed it <\s>
<s> to sum up the matter the right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal <\s>
<s> it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency <\s>
<s> the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemned and now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct <\s>
<s> those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings <\s>
<s> one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial <\s>
<s> but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent <\s>
<s> was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation <\s>
<s> for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once i e <\s>
<s> previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations <\s>
<s> and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected <\s>
<s> it is indeed to be regretted that his majesty's censure was not upon this occasion radical and pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people <\s>
<s> never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit <\s>
<s> for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire <\s>
<s> it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilege but to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny <\s>
