<s> but waiving any considerations of this advice or of the fault which might be committed in not following it and taking up the matter from the time when sir hew dalrymple entered upon the command and when the two adverse armies were in that condition relatively to each other that none of the generals has pleaded any difference of opinion as to their ability to advance against the enemy i will ask what confirmation has appeared before the board of inquiry of the reasonableness of the causes assigned by sir hew dalrymple in his letter for deeming a convention adviseable <\s>
<s> a want of cavalry for which they who occasioned it are heavily censurable has indeed been proved and certain failures of duty in the commissariat department with respect to horses c but these deficiencies though furnishing reasons against advancing upon the enemy in the open field had ceased to be of moment when the business was to expel him from the forts to which he might have the power of retreating <\s>
<s> it is proved that though there are difficulties in landing upon that coast and what military or marine operation can be carried on without difficulty there was not the slightest reason to apprehend that the army which was then abundantly supplied would suffer hereafter from want of provisions proved also that heavy ordnance for the purpose of attacking the forts was ready on ship board to be landed when and where it might be needed <\s>
<s> therefore so far from being exculpated by the facts which have been laid before the board of inquiry sir hew dalrymple and the other generals who deemed any convention necessary or expedient upon the grounds stated in his letter are more deeply criminated <\s>
<s> but grant for the sake of looking at a different part of the subject grant a case infinitely stronger than sir hew dalrymple has even hinted at why was not the taste of some of those evils in apprehension so terrible actually tried <\s>
<s> it would not have been the first time that britons had faced hunger and tempests had endured the worst of such enmity and upon a call under an obligation how faint and feeble compared with that which the brave men of that army must have felt upon the present occasion <\s>
<s> in the proclamation quoted before addressed to the portugueze and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley they were told that the objects for which they contended could only be attained by distinguished examples of fortitude and constancy <\s>
<s> where were the fortitude and constancy of the teachers <\s>
<s> when sir hew dalrymple had been so busy in taking the measure of his own weakness and feeding his own fears how came it to escape him that general junot must also have had his weaknesses and his fears <\s>
<s> was it nothing to have been defeated in the open field where he himself had been the assailant <\s>
<s> was it nothing that so proud a man the servant of so proud a man had stooped to send a general officer to treat concerning the evacuation of the country <\s>
<s> was the hatred and abhorrence of the portugueze and spanish nations nothing <\s>
<s> the people of a large metropolis under his eye detesting him and stung almost to madness nothing <\s>
<s> the composition of his own army made up of men of different nations and languages and forced into the service was there no cause of mistrust in this <\s>
<s> and finally among the many unsound places which had his mind been as active in this sort of inquiry as sir hew dalrymple's was he must have found in his constitution could a bad cause have been missed a worse cause than ever confounded the mind of a soldier when boldly pressed upon or gave courage and animation to a righteous assailant <\s>
<s> in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness <\s>
<s> let me not be misunderstood <\s>
<s> while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them <\s>
<s> but in the name of my countrymen i do repeat these accusations and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courage of that higher quality which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments talents genius or principle talents matured by experience without which it cannot exist at all or the rapid insight of peculiar genius by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them <\s>
<s> thus through the power of genius this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree though the moral character be greatly perverted as in those personages who are so conspicuous in history conquerors and usurpers the alexanders the caesars and cromwells and in that other class still more perverted remorseless and energetic minds the catilines and borgias whom poets have denominated bold bad men <\s>
<s> but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite <\s>
<s> i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act <\s>
<s> the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting <\s>
<s> neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself <\s>
<s> but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are <\s>
<s> for his attention is not distracted he has but one business and that is with the object before him <\s>
<s> neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty <\s>
<s> such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing <\s>
<s> with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost <\s>
<s> lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits <\s>
<s> would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment <\s>
<s> i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested <\s>
<s> see appendix c i maintain then that merely from want of this intellectual courage of courage as generals or chiefs for i will not speak at present of the want of other qualities equally needful upon this service grievous errors were committed by sir hew dalrymple and his colleagues in estimating the relative state of the two armies <\s>
<s> a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted it not merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing terms monstrous terms <\s>
<s> and how ought they to have been received <\s>
<s> repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult <\s>
<s> if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this manner if they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this manner nay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargain maker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwise strange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling <\s>
<s> they were soldiers and their business was to fight <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do 19 19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positive and so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms <\s>
<s> they were to accept and if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility <\s>
<s> this is the general rule of all high minded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle <\s>
<s> but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained <\s>
<s> we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous <\s>
<s> but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack <\s>
<s> the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human blood when or how <\s>
<s> the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours <\s>
<s> what then was to be gained by this tenderness <\s>
<s> the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal to day and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain <\s>
<s> and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight <\s>
<s> for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honour which is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this struggle why not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness <\s>
<s> but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or security she cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirable she has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth <\s>
<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>
<s> for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease <\s>
<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>
<s> thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the re action of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly <\s>
<s> nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries <\s>
<s> and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the hand maid of humanity the attendant and sustainer both of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood <\s>
<s> these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent <\s>
<s> not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of <\s>
<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
<s> it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion <\s>
<s> instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act <\s>

<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>
<s> for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease <\s>
<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>
<s> thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the re action of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly <\s>
<s> nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries <\s>
<s> and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the hand maid of humanity the attendant and sustainer both of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood <\s>
<s> these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent <\s>
<s> not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of <\s>
<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
<s> it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion <\s>
<s> instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act <\s>
<s> were these things done <\s>
<s> or if such evils existed among the portugueze was any remedy or alleviation attempted <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley has told us before the board of inquiry that he made applications to the portugueze general frere for assistance which were acceded to by general frere upon such conditions only as made sir arthur deem it more advisable to refuse than accept his co operation and it is alleged that in his general expectations of assistance he was greatly disappointed <\s>
<s> we are not disposed to deny that such cause for complaint might exist but that it did and upon no provocation on our part requires confirmation by other testimony <\s>
<s> and surely the portugueze have a right to be heard in answer to this accusation before they are condemned <\s>
<s> for they have supplied no fact from their own hands which tends to prove that they were languid in the cause or that they had unreasonable jealousies of the british army or nation or dispositions towards them which were other than friendly <\s>
<s> now there is a fact furnished by sir arthur wellesley himself which may seem to render it in the highest degree probable that previously to any recorded or palpable act of disregard or disrespect to the situation and feelings of the portugueze the general tenour of his bearing towards them might have been such that they could not look favourably upon him that he was not a man framed to conciliate them to compose their differences or to awaken or strengthen their zeal <\s>
<s> i allude to the passage in his letter above quoted where having occasion to speak of the french general he has found no name by which to designate him but that of duc d'abrantes words necessarily implying that bonaparte who had taken upon himself to confer upon general junot this portugueze title with portugueze domains to support it was lawful sovereign of that country and that consequently the portugueze nation were rebels and the british army and he himself at the head of it aiders and abettors of that rebellion <\s>
<s> it would be absurd to suppose that sir arthur wellesley at the time when he used these words was aware of the meaning really involved in them let them be deemed an oversight <\s>
<s> but the capability of such an oversight affords too strong suspicion of a deadness to the moral interests of the cause in which he was engaged and of such a want of sympathy with the just feelings of his injured ally as could exist only in a mind narrowed by exclusive and overweening attention to the military character led astray by vanity or hardened by general habits of contemptuousness <\s>
<s> these words duke of abrantes in person were indeed words of bad omen and thinking men trembled for the consequences <\s>
<s> they saw plainly that in the opinion of the exalted spaniards of those assuredly who framed and of all who had felt that affecting proclamation addressed by the junta of seville to the portugueze people he must appear utterly unworthy of the station in which he had been placed <\s>
<s> he had been sent as a deliverer as an assertor and avenger of the rights of human nature <\s>
<s> but these words would carry with them every where the conviction that portugal and spain yea all which was good in england or iniquitous in france or in frenchmen was forgotten and his head full only of himself miserably conceiting that he swelled the importance of his conquered antagonist by sounding titles and phrases come from what quarter they might and that in proportion as this was done he magnified himself and his achievements <\s>
<s> it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellow feeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression <\s>
<s> these reflections interrupted the satisfaction of many but more from fear of future consequences than for the immediate enterprize for here success seemed inevitable and a happy and glorious termination was confidently expected yet not without that intermixture of apprehension which was at once an acknowledgment of the general condition of humanity and a proof of the deep interest attached to the impending event <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley's dispatches had appeared in the gazette on the 2d of september and on the 16th of the same month suspence was put an end to by the publication of sir hew dalrymple's letter accompanied with the armistice and convention <\s>
<s> the night before by order of ministers an attempt had been made at rejoicing and the park and tower guns had been fired in sign of good news heaven grant that the ears of that great city may be preserved from such another outrage <\s>
<s> as soon as the truth was known never was there such a burst of rage and indignation such an overwhelming of stupefaction and sorrow <\s>
<s> but i will not i cannot dwell upon it it is enough to say that sir hew dalrymple and sir arthur wellesley must he bold men if they can think of what must have been reported to them without awe and trembling the heart of their country was turned against them and they were execrated in bitterness <\s>
<s> for they had changed all things into their contraries hope into despair triumph into defeat confidence into treachery which left no place to stand upon justice into the keenest injury whom had they delivered but the tyrant in captivity <\s>
<s> whose hands had they bound but those of their allies who were able of themselves to have executed their own purposes <\s>
<s> whom had they punished but the innocent sufferer <\s>
<s> whom rewarded but the guiltiest of oppressors <\s>
<s> they had reversed every thing favour and honour for their enemies insult for their friends and robbery they had both protected the person of the robber and secured to him his booty and opprobrium for themselves to those over whom they had been masters who had crouched to them by an open act of submission they had made themselves servants turning the british lion into a beast of burthen to carry a vanquished enemy with his load of iniquities when and whither it had pleased him <\s>
<s> such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a new born power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human nature and by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a worn out government that at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this long wished for spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns <\s>
<s> as soon as men had recovered from the shock and could bear to look somewhat steadily at these documents it was found that the gross body of the transaction considered as a military transaction was this that the russian fleet of nine sail of the line which had been so long watched and could not have escaped was to be delivered up to us the ships to be detained till six months after the end of the war and the sailors sent home by us and to be by us protected in their voyage through the swedish fleet and to be at liberty to fight immediately against our ally the king of sweden <\s>
<s> secondly that a french army of more than twenty thousand men already beaten and no longer able to appear in the field cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements or supplies and in the midst of a hostile country loathing and abhorring it was to be transported with its arms ammunition and plunder at the expence of great britain in british vessels and landed within a few days march of the spanish frontier there to be at liberty to commence hostilities immediately <\s>
<s> omitting every characteristic which distinguishes the present contest from others and looking at this issue merely as an affair between two armies what stupidity of mind to provoke the accusation of not merely shrinking from future toils and dangers but of basely shifting the burthen to the shoulders of an ally already overpressed what infatuation to convey the imprisoned foe to the very spot whither if he had had wings he would have flown <\s>
<s> this last was an absurdity as glaring as if the french having landed on our own island we had taken them from yorkshire to be set on shore in sussex but ten thousand times worse <\s>
<s> from a place where without our interference they had been virtually blockaded where they were cut off hopeless useless and disgraced to become an efficient part of a mighty host carrying the strength of their numbers and alas <\s>
<s> the strength of their glory not to mention the sight of their plunder to animate that host while the british army more numerous in the proportion of three to two with all the population and resources of the peninsula to aid it within ten days sail of it's own country and the sea covered with friendly shipping at it's back was to make a long march to encounter this same enemy the british forfeiting instead of gaining by the treaty as to superiority of numbers for that this would be the case was clearly foreseen to encounter in a new condition of strength and pride those whom by its deliberate act it had exalted having taken from itself meanwhile all which it had conferred and bearing into the presence of its noble ally an infection of despondency and disgrace <\s>
<s> the motive assigned for all this was the great importance of gaining time fear of an open beach and of equinoctial gales for the shipping fear that reinforcements could not be landed fear of famine fear of every thing but dishonour <\s>
<s> see appendix b the nation had expected that the french would surrender immediately at discretion and supposing that sir arthur wellesley had told them the whole truth they had a right to form this expectation <\s>
<s> it has since appeared from the evidence given before the board of inquiry that sir arthur wellesley earnestly exhorted his successor in command sir harry burrard to pursue the defeated enemy at the battle of vimiera and that if this had been done the affair in sir arthur wellesley's opinion would have had a much more satisfactory termination <\s>
<s> but waiving any considerations of this advice or of the fault which might be committed in not following it and taking up the matter from the time when sir hew dalrymple entered upon the command and when the two adverse armies were in that condition relatively to each other that none of the generals has pleaded any difference of opinion as to their ability to advance against the enemy i will ask what confirmation has appeared before the board of inquiry of the reasonableness of the causes assigned by sir hew dalrymple in his letter for deeming a convention adviseable <\s>

<s> such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a new born power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human nature and by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a worn out government that at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this long wished for spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns <\s>
<s> as soon as men had recovered from the shock and could bear to look somewhat steadily at these documents it was found that the gross body of the transaction considered as a military transaction was this that the russian fleet of nine sail of the line which had been so long watched and could not have escaped was to be delivered up to us the ships to be detained till six months after the end of the war and the sailors sent home by us and to be by us protected in their voyage through the swedish fleet and to be at liberty to fight immediately against our ally the king of sweden <\s>
<s> secondly that a french army of more than twenty thousand men already beaten and no longer able to appear in the field cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements or supplies and in the midst of a hostile country loathing and abhorring it was to be transported with its arms ammunition and plunder at the expence of great britain in british vessels and landed within a few days march of the spanish frontier there to be at liberty to commence hostilities immediately <\s>
<s> omitting every characteristic which distinguishes the present contest from others and looking at this issue merely as an affair between two armies what stupidity of mind to provoke the accusation of not merely shrinking from future toils and dangers but of basely shifting the burthen to the shoulders of an ally already overpressed what infatuation to convey the imprisoned foe to the very spot whither if he had had wings he would have flown <\s>
<s> this last was an absurdity as glaring as if the french having landed on our own island we had taken them from yorkshire to be set on shore in sussex but ten thousand times worse <\s>
<s> from a place where without our interference they had been virtually blockaded where they were cut off hopeless useless and disgraced to become an efficient part of a mighty host carrying the strength of their numbers and alas <\s>
<s> the strength of their glory not to mention the sight of their plunder to animate that host while the british army more numerous in the proportion of three to two with all the population and resources of the peninsula to aid it within ten days sail of it's own country and the sea covered with friendly shipping at it's back was to make a long march to encounter this same enemy the british forfeiting instead of gaining by the treaty as to superiority of numbers for that this would be the case was clearly foreseen to encounter in a new condition of strength and pride those whom by its deliberate act it had exalted having taken from itself meanwhile all which it had conferred and bearing into the presence of its noble ally an infection of despondency and disgrace <\s>
<s> the motive assigned for all this was the great importance of gaining time fear of an open beach and of equinoctial gales for the shipping fear that reinforcements could not be landed fear of famine fear of every thing but dishonour <\s>
<s> see appendix b the nation had expected that the french would surrender immediately at discretion and supposing that sir arthur wellesley had told them the whole truth they had a right to form this expectation <\s>
<s> it has since appeared from the evidence given before the board of inquiry that sir arthur wellesley earnestly exhorted his successor in command sir harry burrard to pursue the defeated enemy at the battle of vimiera and that if this had been done the affair in sir arthur wellesley's opinion would have had a much more satisfactory termination <\s>
<s> but waiving any considerations of this advice or of the fault which might be committed in not following it and taking up the matter from the time when sir hew dalrymple entered upon the command and when the two adverse armies were in that condition relatively to each other that none of the generals has pleaded any difference of opinion as to their ability to advance against the enemy i will ask what confirmation has appeared before the board of inquiry of the reasonableness of the causes assigned by sir hew dalrymple in his letter for deeming a convention adviseable <\s>
<s> a want of cavalry for which they who occasioned it are heavily censurable has indeed been proved and certain failures of duty in the commissariat department with respect to horses c but these deficiencies though furnishing reasons against advancing upon the enemy in the open field had ceased to be of moment when the business was to expel him from the forts to which he might have the power of retreating <\s>
<s> it is proved that though there are difficulties in landing upon that coast and what military or marine operation can be carried on without difficulty there was not the slightest reason to apprehend that the army which was then abundantly supplied would suffer hereafter from want of provisions proved also that heavy ordnance for the purpose of attacking the forts was ready on ship board to be landed when and where it might be needed <\s>
<s> therefore so far from being exculpated by the facts which have been laid before the board of inquiry sir hew dalrymple and the other generals who deemed any convention necessary or expedient upon the grounds stated in his letter are more deeply criminated <\s>
<s> but grant for the sake of looking at a different part of the subject grant a case infinitely stronger than sir hew dalrymple has even hinted at why was not the taste of some of those evils in apprehension so terrible actually tried <\s>
<s> it would not have been the first time that britons had faced hunger and tempests had endured the worst of such enmity and upon a call under an obligation how faint and feeble compared with that which the brave men of that army must have felt upon the present occasion <\s>
<s> in the proclamation quoted before addressed to the portugueze and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley they were told that the objects for which they contended could only be attained by distinguished examples of fortitude and constancy <\s>
<s> where were the fortitude and constancy of the teachers <\s>
<s> when sir hew dalrymple had been so busy in taking the measure of his own weakness and feeding his own fears how came it to escape him that general junot must also have had his weaknesses and his fears <\s>
<s> was it nothing to have been defeated in the open field where he himself had been the assailant <\s>
<s> was it nothing that so proud a man the servant of so proud a man had stooped to send a general officer to treat concerning the evacuation of the country <\s>
<s> was the hatred and abhorrence of the portugueze and spanish nations nothing <\s>
<s> the people of a large metropolis under his eye detesting him and stung almost to madness nothing <\s>
<s> the composition of his own army made up of men of different nations and languages and forced into the service was there no cause of mistrust in this <\s>
<s> and finally among the many unsound places which had his mind been as active in this sort of inquiry as sir hew dalrymple's was he must have found in his constitution could a bad cause have been missed a worse cause than ever confounded the mind of a soldier when boldly pressed upon or gave courage and animation to a righteous assailant <\s>
<s> in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness <\s>
<s> let me not be misunderstood <\s>
<s> while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them <\s>
<s> but in the name of my countrymen i do repeat these accusations and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courage of that higher quality which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments talents genius or principle talents matured by experience without which it cannot exist at all or the rapid insight of peculiar genius by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them <\s>
<s> thus through the power of genius this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree though the moral character be greatly perverted as in those personages who are so conspicuous in history conquerors and usurpers the alexanders the caesars and cromwells and in that other class still more perverted remorseless and energetic minds the catilines and borgias whom poets have denominated bold bad men <\s>
<s> but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite <\s>
<s> i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act <\s>
<s> the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting <\s>
<s> neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself <\s>
<s> but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are <\s>
<s> for his attention is not distracted he has but one business and that is with the object before him <\s>
<s> neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty <\s>
<s> such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing <\s>
<s> with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost <\s>
<s> lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits <\s>
<s> would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment <\s>
<s> i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested <\s>
<s> see appendix c i maintain then that merely from want of this intellectual courage of courage as generals or chiefs for i will not speak at present of the want of other qualities equally needful upon this service grievous errors were committed by sir hew dalrymple and his colleagues in estimating the relative state of the two armies <\s>
<s> a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted it not merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing terms monstrous terms <\s>
<s> and how ought they to have been received <\s>
<s> repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult <\s>
<s> if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this manner if they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this manner nay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargain maker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwise strange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling <\s>
<s> they were soldiers and their business was to fight <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do 19 19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positive and so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms <\s>
<s> they were to accept and if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility <\s>
<s> this is the general rule of all high minded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle <\s>
<s> but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained <\s>
<s> we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous <\s>
<s> but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack <\s>
<s> the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human blood when or how <\s>
<s> the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours <\s>
<s> what then was to be gained by this tenderness <\s>
<s> the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal to day and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain <\s>
<s> and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight <\s>
<s> for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honour which is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this struggle why not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness <\s>
<s> but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or security she cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirable she has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth <\s>
<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>

<s> a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted it not merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing terms monstrous terms <\s>
<s> and how ought they to have been received <\s>
<s> repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult <\s>
<s> if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this manner if they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this manner nay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargain maker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwise strange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling <\s>
<s> they were soldiers and their business was to fight <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do 19 19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positive and so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms <\s>
<s> they were to accept and if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility <\s>
<s> this is the general rule of all high minded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle <\s>
<s> but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained <\s>
<s> we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous <\s>
<s> but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack <\s>
<s> the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human blood when or how <\s>
<s> the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours <\s>
<s> what then was to be gained by this tenderness <\s>
<s> the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal to day and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain <\s>
<s> and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight <\s>
<s> for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honour which is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this struggle why not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness <\s>
<s> but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or security she cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirable she has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth <\s>
<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>
<s> for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease <\s>
<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>
<s> thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the re action of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly <\s>
<s> nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries <\s>
<s> and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the hand maid of humanity the attendant and sustainer both of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood <\s>
<s> these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent <\s>
<s> not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of <\s>
<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
<s> it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion <\s>
<s> instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act <\s>
<s> were these things done <\s>
<s> or if such evils existed among the portugueze was any remedy or alleviation attempted <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley has told us before the board of inquiry that he made applications to the portugueze general frere for assistance which were acceded to by general frere upon such conditions only as made sir arthur deem it more advisable to refuse than accept his co operation and it is alleged that in his general expectations of assistance he was greatly disappointed <\s>
<s> we are not disposed to deny that such cause for complaint might exist but that it did and upon no provocation on our part requires confirmation by other testimony <\s>
<s> and surely the portugueze have a right to be heard in answer to this accusation before they are condemned <\s>
<s> for they have supplied no fact from their own hands which tends to prove that they were languid in the cause or that they had unreasonable jealousies of the british army or nation or dispositions towards them which were other than friendly <\s>
<s> now there is a fact furnished by sir arthur wellesley himself which may seem to render it in the highest degree probable that previously to any recorded or palpable act of disregard or disrespect to the situation and feelings of the portugueze the general tenour of his bearing towards them might have been such that they could not look favourably upon him that he was not a man framed to conciliate them to compose their differences or to awaken or strengthen their zeal <\s>
<s> i allude to the passage in his letter above quoted where having occasion to speak of the french general he has found no name by which to designate him but that of duc d'abrantes words necessarily implying that bonaparte who had taken upon himself to confer upon general junot this portugueze title with portugueze domains to support it was lawful sovereign of that country and that consequently the portugueze nation were rebels and the british army and he himself at the head of it aiders and abettors of that rebellion <\s>
<s> it would be absurd to suppose that sir arthur wellesley at the time when he used these words was aware of the meaning really involved in them let them be deemed an oversight <\s>
<s> but the capability of such an oversight affords too strong suspicion of a deadness to the moral interests of the cause in which he was engaged and of such a want of sympathy with the just feelings of his injured ally as could exist only in a mind narrowed by exclusive and overweening attention to the military character led astray by vanity or hardened by general habits of contemptuousness <\s>
<s> these words duke of abrantes in person were indeed words of bad omen and thinking men trembled for the consequences <\s>
<s> they saw plainly that in the opinion of the exalted spaniards of those assuredly who framed and of all who had felt that affecting proclamation addressed by the junta of seville to the portugueze people he must appear utterly unworthy of the station in which he had been placed <\s>
<s> he had been sent as a deliverer as an assertor and avenger of the rights of human nature <\s>
<s> but these words would carry with them every where the conviction that portugal and spain yea all which was good in england or iniquitous in france or in frenchmen was forgotten and his head full only of himself miserably conceiting that he swelled the importance of his conquered antagonist by sounding titles and phrases come from what quarter they might and that in proportion as this was done he magnified himself and his achievements <\s>
<s> it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellow feeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression <\s>
<s> these reflections interrupted the satisfaction of many but more from fear of future consequences than for the immediate enterprize for here success seemed inevitable and a happy and glorious termination was confidently expected yet not without that intermixture of apprehension which was at once an acknowledgment of the general condition of humanity and a proof of the deep interest attached to the impending event <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley's dispatches had appeared in the gazette on the 2d of september and on the 16th of the same month suspence was put an end to by the publication of sir hew dalrymple's letter accompanied with the armistice and convention <\s>
<s> the night before by order of ministers an attempt had been made at rejoicing and the park and tower guns had been fired in sign of good news heaven grant that the ears of that great city may be preserved from such another outrage <\s>
<s> as soon as the truth was known never was there such a burst of rage and indignation such an overwhelming of stupefaction and sorrow <\s>
<s> but i will not i cannot dwell upon it it is enough to say that sir hew dalrymple and sir arthur wellesley must he bold men if they can think of what must have been reported to them without awe and trembling the heart of their country was turned against them and they were execrated in bitterness <\s>
<s> for they had changed all things into their contraries hope into despair triumph into defeat confidence into treachery which left no place to stand upon justice into the keenest injury whom had they delivered but the tyrant in captivity <\s>
<s> whose hands had they bound but those of their allies who were able of themselves to have executed their own purposes <\s>
<s> whom had they punished but the innocent sufferer <\s>
<s> whom rewarded but the guiltiest of oppressors <\s>
<s> they had reversed every thing favour and honour for their enemies insult for their friends and robbery they had both protected the person of the robber and secured to him his booty and opprobrium for themselves to those over whom they had been masters who had crouched to them by an open act of submission they had made themselves servants turning the british lion into a beast of burthen to carry a vanquished enemy with his load of iniquities when and whither it had pleased him <\s>
<s> such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a new born power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human nature and by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a worn out government that at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this long wished for spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns <\s>

<s> i allude to the passage in his letter above quoted where having occasion to speak of the french general he has found no name by which to designate him but that of duc d'abrantes words necessarily implying that bonaparte who had taken upon himself to confer upon general junot this portugueze title with portugueze domains to support it was lawful sovereign of that country and that consequently the portugueze nation were rebels and the british army and he himself at the head of it aiders and abettors of that rebellion <\s>

<s> but these words would carry with them every where the conviction that portugal and spain yea all which was good in england or iniquitous in france or in frenchmen was forgotten and his head full only of himself miserably conceiting that he swelled the importance of his conquered antagonist by sounding titles and phrases come from what quarter they might and that in proportion as this was done he magnified himself and his achievements <\s>
<s> it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellow feeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression <\s>
<s> these reflections interrupted the satisfaction of many but more from fear of future consequences than for the immediate enterprize for here success seemed inevitable and a happy and glorious termination was confidently expected yet not without that intermixture of apprehension which was at once an acknowledgment of the general condition of humanity and a proof of the deep interest attached to the impending event <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley's dispatches had appeared in the gazette on the 2d of september and on the 16th of the same month suspence was put an end to by the publication of sir hew dalrymple's letter accompanied with the armistice and convention <\s>
<s> the night before by order of ministers an attempt had been made at rejoicing and the park and tower guns had been fired in sign of good news heaven grant that the ears of that great city may be preserved from such another outrage <\s>
<s> as soon as the truth was known never was there such a burst of rage and indignation such an overwhelming of stupefaction and sorrow <\s>
<s> but i will not i cannot dwell upon it it is enough to say that sir hew dalrymple and sir arthur wellesley must he bold men if they can think of what must have been reported to them without awe and trembling the heart of their country was turned against them and they were execrated in bitterness <\s>
<s> for they had changed all things into their contraries hope into despair triumph into defeat confidence into treachery which left no place to stand upon justice into the keenest injury whom had they delivered but the tyrant in captivity <\s>
<s> whose hands had they bound but those of their allies who were able of themselves to have executed their own purposes <\s>
<s> whom had they punished but the innocent sufferer <\s>
<s> whom rewarded but the guiltiest of oppressors <\s>
<s> they had reversed every thing favour and honour for their enemies insult for their friends and robbery they had both protected the person of the robber and secured to him his booty and opprobrium for themselves to those over whom they had been masters who had crouched to them by an open act of submission they had made themselves servants turning the british lion into a beast of burthen to carry a vanquished enemy with his load of iniquities when and whither it had pleased him <\s>
<s> such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a new born power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human nature and by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a worn out government that at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this long wished for spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns <\s>
<s> as soon as men had recovered from the shock and could bear to look somewhat steadily at these documents it was found that the gross body of the transaction considered as a military transaction was this that the russian fleet of nine sail of the line which had been so long watched and could not have escaped was to be delivered up to us the ships to be detained till six months after the end of the war and the sailors sent home by us and to be by us protected in their voyage through the swedish fleet and to be at liberty to fight immediately against our ally the king of sweden <\s>
<s> secondly that a french army of more than twenty thousand men already beaten and no longer able to appear in the field cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements or supplies and in the midst of a hostile country loathing and abhorring it was to be transported with its arms ammunition and plunder at the expence of great britain in british vessels and landed within a few days march of the spanish frontier there to be at liberty to commence hostilities immediately <\s>
<s> omitting every characteristic which distinguishes the present contest from others and looking at this issue merely as an affair between two armies what stupidity of mind to provoke the accusation of not merely shrinking from future toils and dangers but of basely shifting the burthen to the shoulders of an ally already overpressed what infatuation to convey the imprisoned foe to the very spot whither if he had had wings he would have flown <\s>
<s> this last was an absurdity as glaring as if the french having landed on our own island we had taken them from yorkshire to be set on shore in sussex but ten thousand times worse <\s>
<s> from a place where without our interference they had been virtually blockaded where they were cut off hopeless useless and disgraced to become an efficient part of a mighty host carrying the strength of their numbers and alas <\s>
<s> the strength of their glory not to mention the sight of their plunder to animate that host while the british army more numerous in the proportion of three to two with all the population and resources of the peninsula to aid it within ten days sail of it's own country and the sea covered with friendly shipping at it's back was to make a long march to encounter this same enemy the british forfeiting instead of gaining by the treaty as to superiority of numbers for that this would be the case was clearly foreseen to encounter in a new condition of strength and pride those whom by its deliberate act it had exalted having taken from itself meanwhile all which it had conferred and bearing into the presence of its noble ally an infection of despondency and disgrace <\s>
<s> the motive assigned for all this was the great importance of gaining time fear of an open beach and of equinoctial gales for the shipping fear that reinforcements could not be landed fear of famine fear of every thing but dishonour <\s>
<s> see appendix b the nation had expected that the french would surrender immediately at discretion and supposing that sir arthur wellesley had told them the whole truth they had a right to form this expectation <\s>
<s> it has since appeared from the evidence given before the board of inquiry that sir arthur wellesley earnestly exhorted his successor in command sir harry burrard to pursue the defeated enemy at the battle of vimiera and that if this had been done the affair in sir arthur wellesley's opinion would have had a much more satisfactory termination <\s>
<s> but waiving any considerations of this advice or of the fault which might be committed in not following it and taking up the matter from the time when sir hew dalrymple entered upon the command and when the two adverse armies were in that condition relatively to each other that none of the generals has pleaded any difference of opinion as to their ability to advance against the enemy i will ask what confirmation has appeared before the board of inquiry of the reasonableness of the causes assigned by sir hew dalrymple in his letter for deeming a convention adviseable <\s>
<s> a want of cavalry for which they who occasioned it are heavily censurable has indeed been proved and certain failures of duty in the commissariat department with respect to horses c but these deficiencies though furnishing reasons against advancing upon the enemy in the open field had ceased to be of moment when the business was to expel him from the forts to which he might have the power of retreating <\s>
<s> it is proved that though there are difficulties in landing upon that coast and what military or marine operation can be carried on without difficulty there was not the slightest reason to apprehend that the army which was then abundantly supplied would suffer hereafter from want of provisions proved also that heavy ordnance for the purpose of attacking the forts was ready on ship board to be landed when and where it might be needed <\s>
<s> therefore so far from being exculpated by the facts which have been laid before the board of inquiry sir hew dalrymple and the other generals who deemed any convention necessary or expedient upon the grounds stated in his letter are more deeply criminated <\s>
<s> but grant for the sake of looking at a different part of the subject grant a case infinitely stronger than sir hew dalrymple has even hinted at why was not the taste of some of those evils in apprehension so terrible actually tried <\s>
<s> it would not have been the first time that britons had faced hunger and tempests had endured the worst of such enmity and upon a call under an obligation how faint and feeble compared with that which the brave men of that army must have felt upon the present occasion <\s>
<s> in the proclamation quoted before addressed to the portugueze and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley they were told that the objects for which they contended could only be attained by distinguished examples of fortitude and constancy <\s>
<s> where were the fortitude and constancy of the teachers <\s>
<s> when sir hew dalrymple had been so busy in taking the measure of his own weakness and feeding his own fears how came it to escape him that general junot must also have had his weaknesses and his fears <\s>
<s> was it nothing to have been defeated in the open field where he himself had been the assailant <\s>
<s> was it nothing that so proud a man the servant of so proud a man had stooped to send a general officer to treat concerning the evacuation of the country <\s>
<s> was the hatred and abhorrence of the portugueze and spanish nations nothing <\s>
<s> the people of a large metropolis under his eye detesting him and stung almost to madness nothing <\s>
<s> the composition of his own army made up of men of different nations and languages and forced into the service was there no cause of mistrust in this <\s>
<s> and finally among the many unsound places which had his mind been as active in this sort of inquiry as sir hew dalrymple's was he must have found in his constitution could a bad cause have been missed a worse cause than ever confounded the mind of a soldier when boldly pressed upon or gave courage and animation to a righteous assailant <\s>
<s> in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness <\s>
<s> let me not be misunderstood <\s>
<s> while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them <\s>
<s> but in the name of my countrymen i do repeat these accusations and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courage of that higher quality which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments talents genius or principle talents matured by experience without which it cannot exist at all or the rapid insight of peculiar genius by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them <\s>
<s> thus through the power of genius this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree though the moral character be greatly perverted as in those personages who are so conspicuous in history conquerors and usurpers the alexanders the caesars and cromwells and in that other class still more perverted remorseless and energetic minds the catilines and borgias whom poets have denominated bold bad men <\s>
<s> but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite <\s>
<s> i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act <\s>
<s> the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting <\s>
<s> neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself <\s>
<s> but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are <\s>
<s> for his attention is not distracted he has but one business and that is with the object before him <\s>
<s> neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty <\s>
<s> such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing <\s>
<s> with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost <\s>
<s> lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits <\s>
<s> would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment <\s>
<s> i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested <\s>

<s> in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness <\s>
<s> let me not be misunderstood <\s>
<s> while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them <\s>
<s> but in the name of my countrymen i do repeat these accusations and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courage of that higher quality which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments talents genius or principle talents matured by experience without which it cannot exist at all or the rapid insight of peculiar genius by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them <\s>
<s> thus through the power of genius this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree though the moral character be greatly perverted as in those personages who are so conspicuous in history conquerors and usurpers the alexanders the caesars and cromwells and in that other class still more perverted remorseless and energetic minds the catilines and borgias whom poets have denominated bold bad men <\s>
<s> but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite <\s>
<s> i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act <\s>
<s> the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting <\s>
<s> neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself <\s>
<s> but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are <\s>
<s> for his attention is not distracted he has but one business and that is with the object before him <\s>
<s> neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty <\s>
<s> such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing <\s>
<s> with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost <\s>
<s> lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits <\s>
<s> would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment <\s>
<s> i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested <\s>
<s> see appendix c i maintain then that merely from want of this intellectual courage of courage as generals or chiefs for i will not speak at present of the want of other qualities equally needful upon this service grievous errors were committed by sir hew dalrymple and his colleagues in estimating the relative state of the two armies <\s>
<s> a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted it not merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing terms monstrous terms <\s>
<s> and how ought they to have been received <\s>
<s> repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult <\s>
<s> if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this manner if they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this manner nay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargain maker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwise strange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling <\s>
<s> they were soldiers and their business was to fight <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do 19 19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positive and so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms <\s>
<s> they were to accept and if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility <\s>
<s> this is the general rule of all high minded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle <\s>
<s> but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained <\s>
<s> we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous <\s>
<s> but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack <\s>
<s> the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human blood when or how <\s>
<s> the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours <\s>
<s> what then was to be gained by this tenderness <\s>
<s> the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal to day and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain <\s>
<s> and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight <\s>
<s> for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honour which is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this struggle why not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness <\s>
<s> but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or security she cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirable she has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth <\s>
<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>
<s> for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease <\s>
<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>
<s> thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the re action of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly <\s>
<s> nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries <\s>
<s> and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the hand maid of humanity the attendant and sustainer both of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood <\s>
<s> these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent <\s>
<s> not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of <\s>
<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
<s> it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion <\s>
<s> instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act <\s>
<s> were these things done <\s>
<s> or if such evils existed among the portugueze was any remedy or alleviation attempted <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley has told us before the board of inquiry that he made applications to the portugueze general frere for assistance which were acceded to by general frere upon such conditions only as made sir arthur deem it more advisable to refuse than accept his co operation and it is alleged that in his general expectations of assistance he was greatly disappointed <\s>
<s> we are not disposed to deny that such cause for complaint might exist but that it did and upon no provocation on our part requires confirmation by other testimony <\s>
<s> and surely the portugueze have a right to be heard in answer to this accusation before they are condemned <\s>
<s> for they have supplied no fact from their own hands which tends to prove that they were languid in the cause or that they had unreasonable jealousies of the british army or nation or dispositions towards them which were other than friendly <\s>
<s> now there is a fact furnished by sir arthur wellesley himself which may seem to render it in the highest degree probable that previously to any recorded or palpable act of disregard or disrespect to the situation and feelings of the portugueze the general tenour of his bearing towards them might have been such that they could not look favourably upon him that he was not a man framed to conciliate them to compose their differences or to awaken or strengthen their zeal <\s>
<s> i allude to the passage in his letter above quoted where having occasion to speak of the french general he has found no name by which to designate him but that of duc d'abrantes words necessarily implying that bonaparte who had taken upon himself to confer upon general junot this portugueze title with portugueze domains to support it was lawful sovereign of that country and that consequently the portugueze nation were rebels and the british army and he himself at the head of it aiders and abettors of that rebellion <\s>
<s> it would be absurd to suppose that sir arthur wellesley at the time when he used these words was aware of the meaning really involved in them let them be deemed an oversight <\s>
<s> but the capability of such an oversight affords too strong suspicion of a deadness to the moral interests of the cause in which he was engaged and of such a want of sympathy with the just feelings of his injured ally as could exist only in a mind narrowed by exclusive and overweening attention to the military character led astray by vanity or hardened by general habits of contemptuousness <\s>
<s> these words duke of abrantes in person were indeed words of bad omen and thinking men trembled for the consequences <\s>
<s> they saw plainly that in the opinion of the exalted spaniards of those assuredly who framed and of all who had felt that affecting proclamation addressed by the junta of seville to the portugueze people he must appear utterly unworthy of the station in which he had been placed <\s>
<s> he had been sent as a deliverer as an assertor and avenger of the rights of human nature <\s>
<s> but these words would carry with them every where the conviction that portugal and spain yea all which was good in england or iniquitous in france or in frenchmen was forgotten and his head full only of himself miserably conceiting that he swelled the importance of his conquered antagonist by sounding titles and phrases come from what quarter they might and that in proportion as this was done he magnified himself and his achievements <\s>
<s> it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellow feeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression <\s>
<s> these reflections interrupted the satisfaction of many but more from fear of future consequences than for the immediate enterprize for here success seemed inevitable and a happy and glorious termination was confidently expected yet not without that intermixture of apprehension which was at once an acknowledgment of the general condition of humanity and a proof of the deep interest attached to the impending event <\s>

<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
<s> it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion <\s>
<s> instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act <\s>
<s> were these things done <\s>
<s> or if such evils existed among the portugueze was any remedy or alleviation attempted <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley has told us before the board of inquiry that he made applications to the portugueze general frere for assistance which were acceded to by general frere upon such conditions only as made sir arthur deem it more advisable to refuse than accept his co operation and it is alleged that in his general expectations of assistance he was greatly disappointed <\s>
<s> we are not disposed to deny that such cause for complaint might exist but that it did and upon no provocation on our part requires confirmation by other testimony <\s>
<s> and surely the portugueze have a right to be heard in answer to this accusation before they are condemned <\s>
<s> for they have supplied no fact from their own hands which tends to prove that they were languid in the cause or that they had unreasonable jealousies of the british army or nation or dispositions towards them which were other than friendly <\s>
<s> now there is a fact furnished by sir arthur wellesley himself which may seem to render it in the highest degree probable that previously to any recorded or palpable act of disregard or disrespect to the situation and feelings of the portugueze the general tenour of his bearing towards them might have been such that they could not look favourably upon him that he was not a man framed to conciliate them to compose their differences or to awaken or strengthen their zeal <\s>
<s> i allude to the passage in his letter above quoted where having occasion to speak of the french general he has found no name by which to designate him but that of duc d'abrantes words necessarily implying that bonaparte who had taken upon himself to confer upon general junot this portugueze title with portugueze domains to support it was lawful sovereign of that country and that consequently the portugueze nation were rebels and the british army and he himself at the head of it aiders and abettors of that rebellion <\s>
<s> it would be absurd to suppose that sir arthur wellesley at the time when he used these words was aware of the meaning really involved in them let them be deemed an oversight <\s>
<s> but the capability of such an oversight affords too strong suspicion of a deadness to the moral interests of the cause in which he was engaged and of such a want of sympathy with the just feelings of his injured ally as could exist only in a mind narrowed by exclusive and overweening attention to the military character led astray by vanity or hardened by general habits of contemptuousness <\s>
<s> these words duke of abrantes in person were indeed words of bad omen and thinking men trembled for the consequences <\s>
<s> they saw plainly that in the opinion of the exalted spaniards of those assuredly who framed and of all who had felt that affecting proclamation addressed by the junta of seville to the portugueze people he must appear utterly unworthy of the station in which he had been placed <\s>
<s> he had been sent as a deliverer as an assertor and avenger of the rights of human nature <\s>
<s> but these words would carry with them every where the conviction that portugal and spain yea all which was good in england or iniquitous in france or in frenchmen was forgotten and his head full only of himself miserably conceiting that he swelled the importance of his conquered antagonist by sounding titles and phrases come from what quarter they might and that in proportion as this was done he magnified himself and his achievements <\s>
<s> it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellow feeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression <\s>
<s> these reflections interrupted the satisfaction of many but more from fear of future consequences than for the immediate enterprize for here success seemed inevitable and a happy and glorious termination was confidently expected yet not without that intermixture of apprehension which was at once an acknowledgment of the general condition of humanity and a proof of the deep interest attached to the impending event <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley's dispatches had appeared in the gazette on the 2d of september and on the 16th of the same month suspence was put an end to by the publication of sir hew dalrymple's letter accompanied with the armistice and convention <\s>
<s> the night before by order of ministers an attempt had been made at rejoicing and the park and tower guns had been fired in sign of good news heaven grant that the ears of that great city may be preserved from such another outrage <\s>
<s> as soon as the truth was known never was there such a burst of rage and indignation such an overwhelming of stupefaction and sorrow <\s>
<s> but i will not i cannot dwell upon it it is enough to say that sir hew dalrymple and sir arthur wellesley must he bold men if they can think of what must have been reported to them without awe and trembling the heart of their country was turned against them and they were execrated in bitterness <\s>
<s> for they had changed all things into their contraries hope into despair triumph into defeat confidence into treachery which left no place to stand upon justice into the keenest injury whom had they delivered but the tyrant in captivity <\s>
<s> whose hands had they bound but those of their allies who were able of themselves to have executed their own purposes <\s>
<s> whom had they punished but the innocent sufferer <\s>
<s> whom rewarded but the guiltiest of oppressors <\s>
<s> they had reversed every thing favour and honour for their enemies insult for their friends and robbery they had both protected the person of the robber and secured to him his booty and opprobrium for themselves to those over whom they had been masters who had crouched to them by an open act of submission they had made themselves servants turning the british lion into a beast of burthen to carry a vanquished enemy with his load of iniquities when and whither it had pleased him <\s>
<s> such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a new born power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human nature and by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a worn out government that at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this long wished for spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns <\s>
<s> as soon as men had recovered from the shock and could bear to look somewhat steadily at these documents it was found that the gross body of the transaction considered as a military transaction was this that the russian fleet of nine sail of the line which had been so long watched and could not have escaped was to be delivered up to us the ships to be detained till six months after the end of the war and the sailors sent home by us and to be by us protected in their voyage through the swedish fleet and to be at liberty to fight immediately against our ally the king of sweden <\s>
<s> secondly that a french army of more than twenty thousand men already beaten and no longer able to appear in the field cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements or supplies and in the midst of a hostile country loathing and abhorring it was to be transported with its arms ammunition and plunder at the expence of great britain in british vessels and landed within a few days march of the spanish frontier there to be at liberty to commence hostilities immediately <\s>
<s> omitting every characteristic which distinguishes the present contest from others and looking at this issue merely as an affair between two armies what stupidity of mind to provoke the accusation of not merely shrinking from future toils and dangers but of basely shifting the burthen to the shoulders of an ally already overpressed what infatuation to convey the imprisoned foe to the very spot whither if he had had wings he would have flown <\s>
<s> this last was an absurdity as glaring as if the french having landed on our own island we had taken them from yorkshire to be set on shore in sussex but ten thousand times worse <\s>
<s> from a place where without our interference they had been virtually blockaded where they were cut off hopeless useless and disgraced to become an efficient part of a mighty host carrying the strength of their numbers and alas <\s>
<s> the strength of their glory not to mention the sight of their plunder to animate that host while the british army more numerous in the proportion of three to two with all the population and resources of the peninsula to aid it within ten days sail of it's own country and the sea covered with friendly shipping at it's back was to make a long march to encounter this same enemy the british forfeiting instead of gaining by the treaty as to superiority of numbers for that this would be the case was clearly foreseen to encounter in a new condition of strength and pride those whom by its deliberate act it had exalted having taken from itself meanwhile all which it had conferred and bearing into the presence of its noble ally an infection of despondency and disgrace <\s>
<s> the motive assigned for all this was the great importance of gaining time fear of an open beach and of equinoctial gales for the shipping fear that reinforcements could not be landed fear of famine fear of every thing but dishonour <\s>
<s> see appendix b the nation had expected that the french would surrender immediately at discretion and supposing that sir arthur wellesley had told them the whole truth they had a right to form this expectation <\s>
<s> it has since appeared from the evidence given before the board of inquiry that sir arthur wellesley earnestly exhorted his successor in command sir harry burrard to pursue the defeated enemy at the battle of vimiera and that if this had been done the affair in sir arthur wellesley's opinion would have had a much more satisfactory termination <\s>
<s> but waiving any considerations of this advice or of the fault which might be committed in not following it and taking up the matter from the time when sir hew dalrymple entered upon the command and when the two adverse armies were in that condition relatively to each other that none of the generals has pleaded any difference of opinion as to their ability to advance against the enemy i will ask what confirmation has appeared before the board of inquiry of the reasonableness of the causes assigned by sir hew dalrymple in his letter for deeming a convention adviseable <\s>
<s> a want of cavalry for which they who occasioned it are heavily censurable has indeed been proved and certain failures of duty in the commissariat department with respect to horses c but these deficiencies though furnishing reasons against advancing upon the enemy in the open field had ceased to be of moment when the business was to expel him from the forts to which he might have the power of retreating <\s>
<s> it is proved that though there are difficulties in landing upon that coast and what military or marine operation can be carried on without difficulty there was not the slightest reason to apprehend that the army which was then abundantly supplied would suffer hereafter from want of provisions proved also that heavy ordnance for the purpose of attacking the forts was ready on ship board to be landed when and where it might be needed <\s>
<s> therefore so far from being exculpated by the facts which have been laid before the board of inquiry sir hew dalrymple and the other generals who deemed any convention necessary or expedient upon the grounds stated in his letter are more deeply criminated <\s>
<s> but grant for the sake of looking at a different part of the subject grant a case infinitely stronger than sir hew dalrymple has even hinted at why was not the taste of some of those evils in apprehension so terrible actually tried <\s>
<s> it would not have been the first time that britons had faced hunger and tempests had endured the worst of such enmity and upon a call under an obligation how faint and feeble compared with that which the brave men of that army must have felt upon the present occasion <\s>
<s> in the proclamation quoted before addressed to the portugueze and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley they were told that the objects for which they contended could only be attained by distinguished examples of fortitude and constancy <\s>
<s> where were the fortitude and constancy of the teachers <\s>
<s> when sir hew dalrymple had been so busy in taking the measure of his own weakness and feeding his own fears how came it to escape him that general junot must also have had his weaknesses and his fears <\s>
<s> was it nothing to have been defeated in the open field where he himself had been the assailant <\s>
<s> was it nothing that so proud a man the servant of so proud a man had stooped to send a general officer to treat concerning the evacuation of the country <\s>
<s> was the hatred and abhorrence of the portugueze and spanish nations nothing <\s>
<s> the people of a large metropolis under his eye detesting him and stung almost to madness nothing <\s>
<s> the composition of his own army made up of men of different nations and languages and forced into the service was there no cause of mistrust in this <\s>
<s> and finally among the many unsound places which had his mind been as active in this sort of inquiry as sir hew dalrymple's was he must have found in his constitution could a bad cause have been missed a worse cause than ever confounded the mind of a soldier when boldly pressed upon or gave courage and animation to a righteous assailant <\s>
<s> in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness <\s>
<s> let me not be misunderstood <\s>
<s> while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them <\s>

<s> therefore so far from being exculpated by the facts which have been laid before the board of inquiry sir hew dalrymple and the other generals who deemed any convention necessary or expedient upon the grounds stated in his letter are more deeply criminated <\s>
<s> but grant for the sake of looking at a different part of the subject grant a case infinitely stronger than sir hew dalrymple has even hinted at why was not the taste of some of those evils in apprehension so terrible actually tried <\s>
<s> it would not have been the first time that britons had faced hunger and tempests had endured the worst of such enmity and upon a call under an obligation how faint and feeble compared with that which the brave men of that army must have felt upon the present occasion <\s>
<s> in the proclamation quoted before addressed to the portugueze and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley they were told that the objects for which they contended could only be attained by distinguished examples of fortitude and constancy <\s>
<s> where were the fortitude and constancy of the teachers <\s>
<s> when sir hew dalrymple had been so busy in taking the measure of his own weakness and feeding his own fears how came it to escape him that general junot must also have had his weaknesses and his fears <\s>
<s> was it nothing to have been defeated in the open field where he himself had been the assailant <\s>
<s> was it nothing that so proud a man the servant of so proud a man had stooped to send a general officer to treat concerning the evacuation of the country <\s>
<s> was the hatred and abhorrence of the portugueze and spanish nations nothing <\s>
<s> the people of a large metropolis under his eye detesting him and stung almost to madness nothing <\s>
<s> the composition of his own army made up of men of different nations and languages and forced into the service was there no cause of mistrust in this <\s>
<s> and finally among the many unsound places which had his mind been as active in this sort of inquiry as sir hew dalrymple's was he must have found in his constitution could a bad cause have been missed a worse cause than ever confounded the mind of a soldier when boldly pressed upon or gave courage and animation to a righteous assailant <\s>
<s> in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness <\s>
<s> let me not be misunderstood <\s>
<s> while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them <\s>
<s> but in the name of my countrymen i do repeat these accusations and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courage of that higher quality which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments talents genius or principle talents matured by experience without which it cannot exist at all or the rapid insight of peculiar genius by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them <\s>
<s> thus through the power of genius this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree though the moral character be greatly perverted as in those personages who are so conspicuous in history conquerors and usurpers the alexanders the caesars and cromwells and in that other class still more perverted remorseless and energetic minds the catilines and borgias whom poets have denominated bold bad men <\s>
<s> but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite <\s>
<s> i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act <\s>
<s> the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting <\s>
<s> neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself <\s>
<s> but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are <\s>
<s> for his attention is not distracted he has but one business and that is with the object before him <\s>
<s> neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty <\s>
<s> such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing <\s>
<s> with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost <\s>
<s> lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits <\s>
<s> would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment <\s>
<s> i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested <\s>
<s> see appendix c i maintain then that merely from want of this intellectual courage of courage as generals or chiefs for i will not speak at present of the want of other qualities equally needful upon this service grievous errors were committed by sir hew dalrymple and his colleagues in estimating the relative state of the two armies <\s>
<s> a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted it not merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing terms monstrous terms <\s>
<s> and how ought they to have been received <\s>
<s> repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult <\s>
<s> if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this manner if they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this manner nay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargain maker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwise strange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling <\s>
<s> they were soldiers and their business was to fight <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do 19 19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positive and so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms <\s>
<s> they were to accept and if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility <\s>
<s> this is the general rule of all high minded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle <\s>
<s> but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained <\s>
<s> we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous <\s>
<s> but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack <\s>
<s> the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human blood when or how <\s>
<s> the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours <\s>
<s> what then was to be gained by this tenderness <\s>
<s> the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal to day and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain <\s>
<s> and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight <\s>
<s> for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honour which is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this struggle why not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness <\s>
<s> but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or security she cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirable she has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth <\s>
<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>
<s> for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease <\s>
<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>
<s> thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the re action of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly <\s>
<s> nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries <\s>
<s> and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the hand maid of humanity the attendant and sustainer both of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood <\s>
<s> these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent <\s>
<s> not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of <\s>
<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
<s> it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion <\s>
<s> instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act <\s>
<s> were these things done <\s>
<s> or if such evils existed among the portugueze was any remedy or alleviation attempted <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley has told us before the board of inquiry that he made applications to the portugueze general frere for assistance which were acceded to by general frere upon such conditions only as made sir arthur deem it more advisable to refuse than accept his co operation and it is alleged that in his general expectations of assistance he was greatly disappointed <\s>
<s> we are not disposed to deny that such cause for complaint might exist but that it did and upon no provocation on our part requires confirmation by other testimony <\s>
<s> and surely the portugueze have a right to be heard in answer to this accusation before they are condemned <\s>

<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>
<s> thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the re action of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly <\s>
<s> nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries <\s>
<s> and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the hand maid of humanity the attendant and sustainer both of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood <\s>
<s> these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent <\s>
<s> not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of <\s>
<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
<s> it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion <\s>
<s> instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act <\s>
<s> were these things done <\s>
<s> or if such evils existed among the portugueze was any remedy or alleviation attempted <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley has told us before the board of inquiry that he made applications to the portugueze general frere for assistance which were acceded to by general frere upon such conditions only as made sir arthur deem it more advisable to refuse than accept his co operation and it is alleged that in his general expectations of assistance he was greatly disappointed <\s>
<s> we are not disposed to deny that such cause for complaint might exist but that it did and upon no provocation on our part requires confirmation by other testimony <\s>
<s> and surely the portugueze have a right to be heard in answer to this accusation before they are condemned <\s>
<s> for they have supplied no fact from their own hands which tends to prove that they were languid in the cause or that they had unreasonable jealousies of the british army or nation or dispositions towards them which were other than friendly <\s>
<s> now there is a fact furnished by sir arthur wellesley himself which may seem to render it in the highest degree probable that previously to any recorded or palpable act of disregard or disrespect to the situation and feelings of the portugueze the general tenour of his bearing towards them might have been such that they could not look favourably upon him that he was not a man framed to conciliate them to compose their differences or to awaken or strengthen their zeal <\s>
<s> i allude to the passage in his letter above quoted where having occasion to speak of the french general he has found no name by which to designate him but that of duc d'abrantes words necessarily implying that bonaparte who had taken upon himself to confer upon general junot this portugueze title with portugueze domains to support it was lawful sovereign of that country and that consequently the portugueze nation were rebels and the british army and he himself at the head of it aiders and abettors of that rebellion <\s>
<s> it would be absurd to suppose that sir arthur wellesley at the time when he used these words was aware of the meaning really involved in them let them be deemed an oversight <\s>
<s> but the capability of such an oversight affords too strong suspicion of a deadness to the moral interests of the cause in which he was engaged and of such a want of sympathy with the just feelings of his injured ally as could exist only in a mind narrowed by exclusive and overweening attention to the military character led astray by vanity or hardened by general habits of contemptuousness <\s>
<s> these words duke of abrantes in person were indeed words of bad omen and thinking men trembled for the consequences <\s>
<s> they saw plainly that in the opinion of the exalted spaniards of those assuredly who framed and of all who had felt that affecting proclamation addressed by the junta of seville to the portugueze people he must appear utterly unworthy of the station in which he had been placed <\s>
<s> he had been sent as a deliverer as an assertor and avenger of the rights of human nature <\s>
<s> but these words would carry with them every where the conviction that portugal and spain yea all which was good in england or iniquitous in france or in frenchmen was forgotten and his head full only of himself miserably conceiting that he swelled the importance of his conquered antagonist by sounding titles and phrases come from what quarter they might and that in proportion as this was done he magnified himself and his achievements <\s>
<s> it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellow feeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression <\s>
<s> these reflections interrupted the satisfaction of many but more from fear of future consequences than for the immediate enterprize for here success seemed inevitable and a happy and glorious termination was confidently expected yet not without that intermixture of apprehension which was at once an acknowledgment of the general condition of humanity and a proof of the deep interest attached to the impending event <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley's dispatches had appeared in the gazette on the 2d of september and on the 16th of the same month suspence was put an end to by the publication of sir hew dalrymple's letter accompanied with the armistice and convention <\s>
<s> the night before by order of ministers an attempt had been made at rejoicing and the park and tower guns had been fired in sign of good news heaven grant that the ears of that great city may be preserved from such another outrage <\s>
<s> as soon as the truth was known never was there such a burst of rage and indignation such an overwhelming of stupefaction and sorrow <\s>
<s> but i will not i cannot dwell upon it it is enough to say that sir hew dalrymple and sir arthur wellesley must he bold men if they can think of what must have been reported to them without awe and trembling the heart of their country was turned against them and they were execrated in bitterness <\s>
<s> for they had changed all things into their contraries hope into despair triumph into defeat confidence into treachery which left no place to stand upon justice into the keenest injury whom had they delivered but the tyrant in captivity <\s>
<s> whose hands had they bound but those of their allies who were able of themselves to have executed their own purposes <\s>
<s> whom had they punished but the innocent sufferer <\s>
<s> whom rewarded but the guiltiest of oppressors <\s>
<s> they had reversed every thing favour and honour for their enemies insult for their friends and robbery they had both protected the person of the robber and secured to him his booty and opprobrium for themselves to those over whom they had been masters who had crouched to them by an open act of submission they had made themselves servants turning the british lion into a beast of burthen to carry a vanquished enemy with his load of iniquities when and whither it had pleased him <\s>
<s> such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a new born power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human nature and by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a worn out government that at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this long wished for spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns <\s>
<s> as soon as men had recovered from the shock and could bear to look somewhat steadily at these documents it was found that the gross body of the transaction considered as a military transaction was this that the russian fleet of nine sail of the line which had been so long watched and could not have escaped was to be delivered up to us the ships to be detained till six months after the end of the war and the sailors sent home by us and to be by us protected in their voyage through the swedish fleet and to be at liberty to fight immediately against our ally the king of sweden <\s>
<s> secondly that a french army of more than twenty thousand men already beaten and no longer able to appear in the field cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements or supplies and in the midst of a hostile country loathing and abhorring it was to be transported with its arms ammunition and plunder at the expence of great britain in british vessels and landed within a few days march of the spanish frontier there to be at liberty to commence hostilities immediately <\s>
<s> omitting every characteristic which distinguishes the present contest from others and looking at this issue merely as an affair between two armies what stupidity of mind to provoke the accusation of not merely shrinking from future toils and dangers but of basely shifting the burthen to the shoulders of an ally already overpressed what infatuation to convey the imprisoned foe to the very spot whither if he had had wings he would have flown <\s>
<s> this last was an absurdity as glaring as if the french having landed on our own island we had taken them from yorkshire to be set on shore in sussex but ten thousand times worse <\s>
<s> from a place where without our interference they had been virtually blockaded where they were cut off hopeless useless and disgraced to become an efficient part of a mighty host carrying the strength of their numbers and alas <\s>
<s> the strength of their glory not to mention the sight of their plunder to animate that host while the british army more numerous in the proportion of three to two with all the population and resources of the peninsula to aid it within ten days sail of it's own country and the sea covered with friendly shipping at it's back was to make a long march to encounter this same enemy the british forfeiting instead of gaining by the treaty as to superiority of numbers for that this would be the case was clearly foreseen to encounter in a new condition of strength and pride those whom by its deliberate act it had exalted having taken from itself meanwhile all which it had conferred and bearing into the presence of its noble ally an infection of despondency and disgrace <\s>
<s> the motive assigned for all this was the great importance of gaining time fear of an open beach and of equinoctial gales for the shipping fear that reinforcements could not be landed fear of famine fear of every thing but dishonour <\s>
<s> see appendix b the nation had expected that the french would surrender immediately at discretion and supposing that sir arthur wellesley had told them the whole truth they had a right to form this expectation <\s>
<s> it has since appeared from the evidence given before the board of inquiry that sir arthur wellesley earnestly exhorted his successor in command sir harry burrard to pursue the defeated enemy at the battle of vimiera and that if this had been done the affair in sir arthur wellesley's opinion would have had a much more satisfactory termination <\s>
<s> but waiving any considerations of this advice or of the fault which might be committed in not following it and taking up the matter from the time when sir hew dalrymple entered upon the command and when the two adverse armies were in that condition relatively to each other that none of the generals has pleaded any difference of opinion as to their ability to advance against the enemy i will ask what confirmation has appeared before the board of inquiry of the reasonableness of the causes assigned by sir hew dalrymple in his letter for deeming a convention adviseable <\s>
<s> a want of cavalry for which they who occasioned it are heavily censurable has indeed been proved and certain failures of duty in the commissariat department with respect to horses c but these deficiencies though furnishing reasons against advancing upon the enemy in the open field had ceased to be of moment when the business was to expel him from the forts to which he might have the power of retreating <\s>
<s> it is proved that though there are difficulties in landing upon that coast and what military or marine operation can be carried on without difficulty there was not the slightest reason to apprehend that the army which was then abundantly supplied would suffer hereafter from want of provisions proved also that heavy ordnance for the purpose of attacking the forts was ready on ship board to be landed when and where it might be needed <\s>

<s> such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a new born power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human nature and by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a worn out government that at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this long wished for spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns <\s>
<s> as soon as men had recovered from the shock and could bear to look somewhat steadily at these documents it was found that the gross body of the transaction considered as a military transaction was this that the russian fleet of nine sail of the line which had been so long watched and could not have escaped was to be delivered up to us the ships to be detained till six months after the end of the war and the sailors sent home by us and to be by us protected in their voyage through the swedish fleet and to be at liberty to fight immediately against our ally the king of sweden <\s>
<s> secondly that a french army of more than twenty thousand men already beaten and no longer able to appear in the field cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements or supplies and in the midst of a hostile country loathing and abhorring it was to be transported with its arms ammunition and plunder at the expence of great britain in british vessels and landed within a few days march of the spanish frontier there to be at liberty to commence hostilities immediately <\s>
<s> omitting every characteristic which distinguishes the present contest from others and looking at this issue merely as an affair between two armies what stupidity of mind to provoke the accusation of not merely shrinking from future toils and dangers but of basely shifting the burthen to the shoulders of an ally already overpressed what infatuation to convey the imprisoned foe to the very spot whither if he had had wings he would have flown <\s>
<s> this last was an absurdity as glaring as if the french having landed on our own island we had taken them from yorkshire to be set on shore in sussex but ten thousand times worse <\s>
<s> from a place where without our interference they had been virtually blockaded where they were cut off hopeless useless and disgraced to become an efficient part of a mighty host carrying the strength of their numbers and alas <\s>
<s> the strength of their glory not to mention the sight of their plunder to animate that host while the british army more numerous in the proportion of three to two with all the population and resources of the peninsula to aid it within ten days sail of it's own country and the sea covered with friendly shipping at it's back was to make a long march to encounter this same enemy the british forfeiting instead of gaining by the treaty as to superiority of numbers for that this would be the case was clearly foreseen to encounter in a new condition of strength and pride those whom by its deliberate act it had exalted having taken from itself meanwhile all which it had conferred and bearing into the presence of its noble ally an infection of despondency and disgrace <\s>
<s> the motive assigned for all this was the great importance of gaining time fear of an open beach and of equinoctial gales for the shipping fear that reinforcements could not be landed fear of famine fear of every thing but dishonour <\s>
<s> see appendix b the nation had expected that the french would surrender immediately at discretion and supposing that sir arthur wellesley had told them the whole truth they had a right to form this expectation <\s>
<s> it has since appeared from the evidence given before the board of inquiry that sir arthur wellesley earnestly exhorted his successor in command sir harry burrard to pursue the defeated enemy at the battle of vimiera and that if this had been done the affair in sir arthur wellesley's opinion would have had a much more satisfactory termination <\s>
<s> but waiving any considerations of this advice or of the fault which might be committed in not following it and taking up the matter from the time when sir hew dalrymple entered upon the command and when the two adverse armies were in that condition relatively to each other that none of the generals has pleaded any difference of opinion as to their ability to advance against the enemy i will ask what confirmation has appeared before the board of inquiry of the reasonableness of the causes assigned by sir hew dalrymple in his letter for deeming a convention adviseable <\s>
<s> a want of cavalry for which they who occasioned it are heavily censurable has indeed been proved and certain failures of duty in the commissariat department with respect to horses c but these deficiencies though furnishing reasons against advancing upon the enemy in the open field had ceased to be of moment when the business was to expel him from the forts to which he might have the power of retreating <\s>
<s> it is proved that though there are difficulties in landing upon that coast and what military or marine operation can be carried on without difficulty there was not the slightest reason to apprehend that the army which was then abundantly supplied would suffer hereafter from want of provisions proved also that heavy ordnance for the purpose of attacking the forts was ready on ship board to be landed when and where it might be needed <\s>
<s> therefore so far from being exculpated by the facts which have been laid before the board of inquiry sir hew dalrymple and the other generals who deemed any convention necessary or expedient upon the grounds stated in his letter are more deeply criminated <\s>
<s> but grant for the sake of looking at a different part of the subject grant a case infinitely stronger than sir hew dalrymple has even hinted at why was not the taste of some of those evils in apprehension so terrible actually tried <\s>
<s> it would not have been the first time that britons had faced hunger and tempests had endured the worst of such enmity and upon a call under an obligation how faint and feeble compared with that which the brave men of that army must have felt upon the present occasion <\s>
<s> in the proclamation quoted before addressed to the portugueze and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley they were told that the objects for which they contended could only be attained by distinguished examples of fortitude and constancy <\s>
<s> where were the fortitude and constancy of the teachers <\s>
<s> when sir hew dalrymple had been so busy in taking the measure of his own weakness and feeding his own fears how came it to escape him that general junot must also have had his weaknesses and his fears <\s>
<s> was it nothing to have been defeated in the open field where he himself had been the assailant <\s>
<s> was it nothing that so proud a man the servant of so proud a man had stooped to send a general officer to treat concerning the evacuation of the country <\s>
<s> was the hatred and abhorrence of the portugueze and spanish nations nothing <\s>
<s> the people of a large metropolis under his eye detesting him and stung almost to madness nothing <\s>
<s> the composition of his own army made up of men of different nations and languages and forced into the service was there no cause of mistrust in this <\s>
<s> and finally among the many unsound places which had his mind been as active in this sort of inquiry as sir hew dalrymple's was he must have found in his constitution could a bad cause have been missed a worse cause than ever confounded the mind of a soldier when boldly pressed upon or gave courage and animation to a righteous assailant <\s>
<s> in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness <\s>
<s> let me not be misunderstood <\s>
<s> while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them <\s>
<s> but in the name of my countrymen i do repeat these accusations and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courage of that higher quality which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments talents genius or principle talents matured by experience without which it cannot exist at all or the rapid insight of peculiar genius by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them <\s>
<s> thus through the power of genius this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree though the moral character be greatly perverted as in those personages who are so conspicuous in history conquerors and usurpers the alexanders the caesars and cromwells and in that other class still more perverted remorseless and energetic minds the catilines and borgias whom poets have denominated bold bad men <\s>
<s> but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite <\s>
<s> i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act <\s>
<s> the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting <\s>
<s> neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself <\s>
<s> but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are <\s>
<s> for his attention is not distracted he has but one business and that is with the object before him <\s>
<s> neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty <\s>
<s> such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing <\s>
<s> with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost <\s>
<s> lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits <\s>
<s> would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment <\s>
<s> i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested <\s>
<s> see appendix c i maintain then that merely from want of this intellectual courage of courage as generals or chiefs for i will not speak at present of the want of other qualities equally needful upon this service grievous errors were committed by sir hew dalrymple and his colleagues in estimating the relative state of the two armies <\s>
<s> a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted it not merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing terms monstrous terms <\s>
<s> and how ought they to have been received <\s>
<s> repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult <\s>
<s> if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this manner if they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this manner nay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargain maker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwise strange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling <\s>
<s> they were soldiers and their business was to fight <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do 19 19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positive and so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms <\s>
<s> they were to accept and if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility <\s>
<s> this is the general rule of all high minded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle <\s>
<s> but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained <\s>
<s> we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous <\s>
<s> but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack <\s>
<s> the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human blood when or how <\s>
<s> the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours <\s>
<s> what then was to be gained by this tenderness <\s>
<s> the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal to day and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain <\s>
<s> and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight <\s>
<s> for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honour which is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this struggle why not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness <\s>
<s> but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or security she cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirable she has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth <\s>
<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>
<s> for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease <\s>
<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>

<s> if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this manner if they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this manner nay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargain maker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwise strange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling <\s>
<s> they were soldiers and their business was to fight <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do 19 19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positive and so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms <\s>
<s> they were to accept and if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility <\s>
<s> this is the general rule of all high minded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle <\s>
<s> but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained <\s>
<s> we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous <\s>
<s> but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack <\s>
<s> the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human blood when or how <\s>
<s> the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours <\s>
<s> what then was to be gained by this tenderness <\s>
<s> the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal to day and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain <\s>
<s> and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight <\s>
<s> for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honour which is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this struggle why not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness <\s>
<s> but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or security she cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirable she has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth <\s>
<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>
<s> for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease <\s>
<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>
<s> thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the re action of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly <\s>
<s> nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries <\s>
<s> and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the hand maid of humanity the attendant and sustainer both of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood <\s>
<s> these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent <\s>
<s> not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of <\s>
<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
<s> it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion <\s>
<s> instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act <\s>
<s> were these things done <\s>
<s> or if such evils existed among the portugueze was any remedy or alleviation attempted <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley has told us before the board of inquiry that he made applications to the portugueze general frere for assistance which were acceded to by general frere upon such conditions only as made sir arthur deem it more advisable to refuse than accept his co operation and it is alleged that in his general expectations of assistance he was greatly disappointed <\s>
<s> we are not disposed to deny that such cause for complaint might exist but that it did and upon no provocation on our part requires confirmation by other testimony <\s>
<s> and surely the portugueze have a right to be heard in answer to this accusation before they are condemned <\s>
<s> for they have supplied no fact from their own hands which tends to prove that they were languid in the cause or that they had unreasonable jealousies of the british army or nation or dispositions towards them which were other than friendly <\s>
<s> now there is a fact furnished by sir arthur wellesley himself which may seem to render it in the highest degree probable that previously to any recorded or palpable act of disregard or disrespect to the situation and feelings of the portugueze the general tenour of his bearing towards them might have been such that they could not look favourably upon him that he was not a man framed to conciliate them to compose their differences or to awaken or strengthen their zeal <\s>
<s> i allude to the passage in his letter above quoted where having occasion to speak of the french general he has found no name by which to designate him but that of duc d'abrantes words necessarily implying that bonaparte who had taken upon himself to confer upon general junot this portugueze title with portugueze domains to support it was lawful sovereign of that country and that consequently the portugueze nation were rebels and the british army and he himself at the head of it aiders and abettors of that rebellion <\s>
<s> it would be absurd to suppose that sir arthur wellesley at the time when he used these words was aware of the meaning really involved in them let them be deemed an oversight <\s>
<s> but the capability of such an oversight affords too strong suspicion of a deadness to the moral interests of the cause in which he was engaged and of such a want of sympathy with the just feelings of his injured ally as could exist only in a mind narrowed by exclusive and overweening attention to the military character led astray by vanity or hardened by general habits of contemptuousness <\s>
<s> these words duke of abrantes in person were indeed words of bad omen and thinking men trembled for the consequences <\s>
<s> they saw plainly that in the opinion of the exalted spaniards of those assuredly who framed and of all who had felt that affecting proclamation addressed by the junta of seville to the portugueze people he must appear utterly unworthy of the station in which he had been placed <\s>
<s> he had been sent as a deliverer as an assertor and avenger of the rights of human nature <\s>
<s> but these words would carry with them every where the conviction that portugal and spain yea all which was good in england or iniquitous in france or in frenchmen was forgotten and his head full only of himself miserably conceiting that he swelled the importance of his conquered antagonist by sounding titles and phrases come from what quarter they might and that in proportion as this was done he magnified himself and his achievements <\s>
<s> it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellow feeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression <\s>
<s> these reflections interrupted the satisfaction of many but more from fear of future consequences than for the immediate enterprize for here success seemed inevitable and a happy and glorious termination was confidently expected yet not without that intermixture of apprehension which was at once an acknowledgment of the general condition of humanity and a proof of the deep interest attached to the impending event <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley's dispatches had appeared in the gazette on the 2d of september and on the 16th of the same month suspence was put an end to by the publication of sir hew dalrymple's letter accompanied with the armistice and convention <\s>
<s> the night before by order of ministers an attempt had been made at rejoicing and the park and tower guns had been fired in sign of good news heaven grant that the ears of that great city may be preserved from such another outrage <\s>
<s> as soon as the truth was known never was there such a burst of rage and indignation such an overwhelming of stupefaction and sorrow <\s>
<s> but i will not i cannot dwell upon it it is enough to say that sir hew dalrymple and sir arthur wellesley must he bold men if they can think of what must have been reported to them without awe and trembling the heart of their country was turned against them and they were execrated in bitterness <\s>
<s> for they had changed all things into their contraries hope into despair triumph into defeat confidence into treachery which left no place to stand upon justice into the keenest injury whom had they delivered but the tyrant in captivity <\s>
<s> whose hands had they bound but those of their allies who were able of themselves to have executed their own purposes <\s>
<s> whom had they punished but the innocent sufferer <\s>
<s> whom rewarded but the guiltiest of oppressors <\s>
<s> they had reversed every thing favour and honour for their enemies insult for their friends and robbery they had both protected the person of the robber and secured to him his booty and opprobrium for themselves to those over whom they had been masters who had crouched to them by an open act of submission they had made themselves servants turning the british lion into a beast of burthen to carry a vanquished enemy with his load of iniquities when and whither it had pleased him <\s>
<s> such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a new born power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human nature and by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a worn out government that at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this long wished for spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns <\s>
<s> as soon as men had recovered from the shock and could bear to look somewhat steadily at these documents it was found that the gross body of the transaction considered as a military transaction was this that the russian fleet of nine sail of the line which had been so long watched and could not have escaped was to be delivered up to us the ships to be detained till six months after the end of the war and the sailors sent home by us and to be by us protected in their voyage through the swedish fleet and to be at liberty to fight immediately against our ally the king of sweden <\s>

<s> it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellow feeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression <\s>

<s> sir arthur wellesley's dispatches had appeared in the gazette on the 2d of september and on the 16th of the same month suspence was put an end to by the publication of sir hew dalrymple's letter accompanied with the armistice and convention <\s>
<s> the night before by order of ministers an attempt had been made at rejoicing and the park and tower guns had been fired in sign of good news heaven grant that the ears of that great city may be preserved from such another outrage <\s>
<s> as soon as the truth was known never was there such a burst of rage and indignation such an overwhelming of stupefaction and sorrow <\s>
<s> but i will not i cannot dwell upon it it is enough to say that sir hew dalrymple and sir arthur wellesley must he bold men if they can think of what must have been reported to them without awe and trembling the heart of their country was turned against them and they were execrated in bitterness <\s>
<s> for they had changed all things into their contraries hope into despair triumph into defeat confidence into treachery which left no place to stand upon justice into the keenest injury whom had they delivered but the tyrant in captivity <\s>
<s> whose hands had they bound but those of their allies who were able of themselves to have executed their own purposes <\s>
<s> whom had they punished but the innocent sufferer <\s>
<s> whom rewarded but the guiltiest of oppressors <\s>
<s> they had reversed every thing favour and honour for their enemies insult for their friends and robbery they had both protected the person of the robber and secured to him his booty and opprobrium for themselves to those over whom they had been masters who had crouched to them by an open act of submission they had made themselves servants turning the british lion into a beast of burthen to carry a vanquished enemy with his load of iniquities when and whither it had pleased him <\s>
<s> such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a new born power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human nature and by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a worn out government that at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this long wished for spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns <\s>
<s> as soon as men had recovered from the shock and could bear to look somewhat steadily at these documents it was found that the gross body of the transaction considered as a military transaction was this that the russian fleet of nine sail of the line which had been so long watched and could not have escaped was to be delivered up to us the ships to be detained till six months after the end of the war and the sailors sent home by us and to be by us protected in their voyage through the swedish fleet and to be at liberty to fight immediately against our ally the king of sweden <\s>
<s> secondly that a french army of more than twenty thousand men already beaten and no longer able to appear in the field cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements or supplies and in the midst of a hostile country loathing and abhorring it was to be transported with its arms ammunition and plunder at the expence of great britain in british vessels and landed within a few days march of the spanish frontier there to be at liberty to commence hostilities immediately <\s>
<s> omitting every characteristic which distinguishes the present contest from others and looking at this issue merely as an affair between two armies what stupidity of mind to provoke the accusation of not merely shrinking from future toils and dangers but of basely shifting the burthen to the shoulders of an ally already overpressed what infatuation to convey the imprisoned foe to the very spot whither if he had had wings he would have flown <\s>
<s> this last was an absurdity as glaring as if the french having landed on our own island we had taken them from yorkshire to be set on shore in sussex but ten thousand times worse <\s>
<s> from a place where without our interference they had been virtually blockaded where they were cut off hopeless useless and disgraced to become an efficient part of a mighty host carrying the strength of their numbers and alas <\s>
<s> the strength of their glory not to mention the sight of their plunder to animate that host while the british army more numerous in the proportion of three to two with all the population and resources of the peninsula to aid it within ten days sail of it's own country and the sea covered with friendly shipping at it's back was to make a long march to encounter this same enemy the british forfeiting instead of gaining by the treaty as to superiority of numbers for that this would be the case was clearly foreseen to encounter in a new condition of strength and pride those whom by its deliberate act it had exalted having taken from itself meanwhile all which it had conferred and bearing into the presence of its noble ally an infection of despondency and disgrace <\s>
<s> the motive assigned for all this was the great importance of gaining time fear of an open beach and of equinoctial gales for the shipping fear that reinforcements could not be landed fear of famine fear of every thing but dishonour <\s>
<s> see appendix b the nation had expected that the french would surrender immediately at discretion and supposing that sir arthur wellesley had told them the whole truth they had a right to form this expectation <\s>
<s> it has since appeared from the evidence given before the board of inquiry that sir arthur wellesley earnestly exhorted his successor in command sir harry burrard to pursue the defeated enemy at the battle of vimiera and that if this had been done the affair in sir arthur wellesley's opinion would have had a much more satisfactory termination <\s>
<s> but waiving any considerations of this advice or of the fault which might be committed in not following it and taking up the matter from the time when sir hew dalrymple entered upon the command and when the two adverse armies were in that condition relatively to each other that none of the generals has pleaded any difference of opinion as to their ability to advance against the enemy i will ask what confirmation has appeared before the board of inquiry of the reasonableness of the causes assigned by sir hew dalrymple in his letter for deeming a convention adviseable <\s>
<s> a want of cavalry for which they who occasioned it are heavily censurable has indeed been proved and certain failures of duty in the commissariat department with respect to horses c but these deficiencies though furnishing reasons against advancing upon the enemy in the open field had ceased to be of moment when the business was to expel him from the forts to which he might have the power of retreating <\s>
<s> it is proved that though there are difficulties in landing upon that coast and what military or marine operation can be carried on without difficulty there was not the slightest reason to apprehend that the army which was then abundantly supplied would suffer hereafter from want of provisions proved also that heavy ordnance for the purpose of attacking the forts was ready on ship board to be landed when and where it might be needed <\s>
<s> therefore so far from being exculpated by the facts which have been laid before the board of inquiry sir hew dalrymple and the other generals who deemed any convention necessary or expedient upon the grounds stated in his letter are more deeply criminated <\s>
<s> but grant for the sake of looking at a different part of the subject grant a case infinitely stronger than sir hew dalrymple has even hinted at why was not the taste of some of those evils in apprehension so terrible actually tried <\s>
<s> it would not have been the first time that britons had faced hunger and tempests had endured the worst of such enmity and upon a call under an obligation how faint and feeble compared with that which the brave men of that army must have felt upon the present occasion <\s>
<s> in the proclamation quoted before addressed to the portugueze and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley they were told that the objects for which they contended could only be attained by distinguished examples of fortitude and constancy <\s>
<s> where were the fortitude and constancy of the teachers <\s>
<s> when sir hew dalrymple had been so busy in taking the measure of his own weakness and feeding his own fears how came it to escape him that general junot must also have had his weaknesses and his fears <\s>
<s> was it nothing to have been defeated in the open field where he himself had been the assailant <\s>
<s> was it nothing that so proud a man the servant of so proud a man had stooped to send a general officer to treat concerning the evacuation of the country <\s>
<s> was the hatred and abhorrence of the portugueze and spanish nations nothing <\s>
<s> the people of a large metropolis under his eye detesting him and stung almost to madness nothing <\s>
<s> the composition of his own army made up of men of different nations and languages and forced into the service was there no cause of mistrust in this <\s>
<s> and finally among the many unsound places which had his mind been as active in this sort of inquiry as sir hew dalrymple's was he must have found in his constitution could a bad cause have been missed a worse cause than ever confounded the mind of a soldier when boldly pressed upon or gave courage and animation to a righteous assailant <\s>
<s> in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness <\s>
<s> let me not be misunderstood <\s>
<s> while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them <\s>
<s> but in the name of my countrymen i do repeat these accusations and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courage of that higher quality which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments talents genius or principle talents matured by experience without which it cannot exist at all or the rapid insight of peculiar genius by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them <\s>
<s> thus through the power of genius this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree though the moral character be greatly perverted as in those personages who are so conspicuous in history conquerors and usurpers the alexanders the caesars and cromwells and in that other class still more perverted remorseless and energetic minds the catilines and borgias whom poets have denominated bold bad men <\s>
<s> but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite <\s>
<s> i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act <\s>
<s> the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting <\s>
<s> neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself <\s>
<s> but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are <\s>
<s> for his attention is not distracted he has but one business and that is with the object before him <\s>
<s> neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty <\s>
<s> such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing <\s>
<s> with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost <\s>
<s> lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits <\s>
<s> would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment <\s>
<s> i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested <\s>
<s> see appendix c i maintain then that merely from want of this intellectual courage of courage as generals or chiefs for i will not speak at present of the want of other qualities equally needful upon this service grievous errors were committed by sir hew dalrymple and his colleagues in estimating the relative state of the two armies <\s>
<s> a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted it not merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing terms monstrous terms <\s>
<s> and how ought they to have been received <\s>
<s> repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult <\s>

<s> in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness <\s>
<s> let me not be misunderstood <\s>
<s> while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them <\s>
<s> but in the name of my countrymen i do repeat these accusations and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courage of that higher quality which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments talents genius or principle talents matured by experience without which it cannot exist at all or the rapid insight of peculiar genius by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them <\s>
<s> thus through the power of genius this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree though the moral character be greatly perverted as in those personages who are so conspicuous in history conquerors and usurpers the alexanders the caesars and cromwells and in that other class still more perverted remorseless and energetic minds the catilines and borgias whom poets have denominated bold bad men <\s>
<s> but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite <\s>
<s> i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act <\s>
<s> the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting <\s>
<s> neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself <\s>
<s> but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are <\s>
<s> for his attention is not distracted he has but one business and that is with the object before him <\s>
<s> neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty <\s>
<s> such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing <\s>
<s> with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost <\s>
<s> lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits <\s>
<s> would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment <\s>
<s> i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested <\s>
<s> see appendix c i maintain then that merely from want of this intellectual courage of courage as generals or chiefs for i will not speak at present of the want of other qualities equally needful upon this service grievous errors were committed by sir hew dalrymple and his colleagues in estimating the relative state of the two armies <\s>
<s> a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted it not merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing terms monstrous terms <\s>
<s> and how ought they to have been received <\s>
<s> repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult <\s>
<s> if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this manner if they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this manner nay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargain maker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwise strange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling <\s>
<s> they were soldiers and their business was to fight <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do 19 19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positive and so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms <\s>
<s> they were to accept and if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility <\s>
<s> this is the general rule of all high minded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle <\s>
<s> but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained <\s>
<s> we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous <\s>
<s> but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack <\s>
<s> the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human blood when or how <\s>
<s> the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours <\s>
<s> what then was to be gained by this tenderness <\s>
<s> the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal to day and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain <\s>
<s> and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight <\s>
<s> for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honour which is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this struggle why not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness <\s>
<s> but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or security she cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirable she has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth <\s>
<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>
<s> for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease <\s>
<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>
<s> thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the re action of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly <\s>
<s> nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries <\s>
<s> and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the hand maid of humanity the attendant and sustainer both of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood <\s>
<s> these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent <\s>
<s> not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of <\s>
<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
<s> it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion <\s>
<s> instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act <\s>
<s> were these things done <\s>
<s> or if such evils existed among the portugueze was any remedy or alleviation attempted <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley has told us before the board of inquiry that he made applications to the portugueze general frere for assistance which were acceded to by general frere upon such conditions only as made sir arthur deem it more advisable to refuse than accept his co operation and it is alleged that in his general expectations of assistance he was greatly disappointed <\s>
<s> we are not disposed to deny that such cause for complaint might exist but that it did and upon no provocation on our part requires confirmation by other testimony <\s>
<s> and surely the portugueze have a right to be heard in answer to this accusation before they are condemned <\s>
<s> for they have supplied no fact from their own hands which tends to prove that they were languid in the cause or that they had unreasonable jealousies of the british army or nation or dispositions towards them which were other than friendly <\s>
<s> now there is a fact furnished by sir arthur wellesley himself which may seem to render it in the highest degree probable that previously to any recorded or palpable act of disregard or disrespect to the situation and feelings of the portugueze the general tenour of his bearing towards them might have been such that they could not look favourably upon him that he was not a man framed to conciliate them to compose their differences or to awaken or strengthen their zeal <\s>
<s> i allude to the passage in his letter above quoted where having occasion to speak of the french general he has found no name by which to designate him but that of duc d'abrantes words necessarily implying that bonaparte who had taken upon himself to confer upon general junot this portugueze title with portugueze domains to support it was lawful sovereign of that country and that consequently the portugueze nation were rebels and the british army and he himself at the head of it aiders and abettors of that rebellion <\s>
<s> it would be absurd to suppose that sir arthur wellesley at the time when he used these words was aware of the meaning really involved in them let them be deemed an oversight <\s>
<s> but the capability of such an oversight affords too strong suspicion of a deadness to the moral interests of the cause in which he was engaged and of such a want of sympathy with the just feelings of his injured ally as could exist only in a mind narrowed by exclusive and overweening attention to the military character led astray by vanity or hardened by general habits of contemptuousness <\s>
<s> these words duke of abrantes in person were indeed words of bad omen and thinking men trembled for the consequences <\s>
<s> they saw plainly that in the opinion of the exalted spaniards of those assuredly who framed and of all who had felt that affecting proclamation addressed by the junta of seville to the portugueze people he must appear utterly unworthy of the station in which he had been placed <\s>
<s> he had been sent as a deliverer as an assertor and avenger of the rights of human nature <\s>
<s> but these words would carry with them every where the conviction that portugal and spain yea all which was good in england or iniquitous in france or in frenchmen was forgotten and his head full only of himself miserably conceiting that he swelled the importance of his conquered antagonist by sounding titles and phrases come from what quarter they might and that in proportion as this was done he magnified himself and his achievements <\s>
<s> it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellow feeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression <\s>
<s> these reflections interrupted the satisfaction of many but more from fear of future consequences than for the immediate enterprize for here success seemed inevitable and a happy and glorious termination was confidently expected yet not without that intermixture of apprehension which was at once an acknowledgment of the general condition of humanity and a proof of the deep interest attached to the impending event <\s>

<s> but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite <\s>
<s> i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act <\s>
<s> the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting <\s>
<s> neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself <\s>
<s> but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are <\s>
<s> for his attention is not distracted he has but one business and that is with the object before him <\s>
<s> neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty <\s>
<s> such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing <\s>
<s> with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost <\s>
<s> lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits <\s>
<s> would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment <\s>
<s> i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested <\s>
<s> see appendix c i maintain then that merely from want of this intellectual courage of courage as generals or chiefs for i will not speak at present of the want of other qualities equally needful upon this service grievous errors were committed by sir hew dalrymple and his colleagues in estimating the relative state of the two armies <\s>
<s> a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted it not merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing terms monstrous terms <\s>
<s> and how ought they to have been received <\s>
<s> repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult <\s>
<s> if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this manner if they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this manner nay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargain maker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwise strange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling <\s>
<s> they were soldiers and their business was to fight <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do 19 19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positive and so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms <\s>
<s> they were to accept and if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility <\s>
<s> this is the general rule of all high minded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle <\s>
<s> but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained <\s>
<s> we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous <\s>
<s> but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack <\s>
<s> the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human blood when or how <\s>
<s> the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours <\s>
<s> what then was to be gained by this tenderness <\s>
<s> the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal to day and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain <\s>
<s> and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight <\s>
<s> for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honour which is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this struggle why not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness <\s>
<s> but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or security she cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirable she has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth <\s>
<s> yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an ill judging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction <\s>
<s> for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease <\s>
<s> the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any where in which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or that wars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion <\s>
<s> if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put on if we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned <\s>
<s> moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen <\s>
<s> for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt <\s>
<s> thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the re action of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly <\s>
<s> nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries <\s>
<s> and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the hand maid of humanity the attendant and sustainer both of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood <\s>
<s> these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent <\s>
<s> not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of <\s>
<s> but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof <\s>
