<s> this division of the prose has cost the editor more labour and thought than any other from the scattered and hitherto unclassified semi publication of these notes <\s>
<s> those called original are from the first and successive editions of the poems being found in some and absent in other collections <\s>
<s> an endeavour has been made to include everything even the briefest for judging by himself the editor believes that to the reverent and thoughtful student of wordsworth the slightest thing is of interest e g one turns to the most commonplace book of topography or contemporary verse in any way noticed by him just because it is wordsworth who has noticed it while an old ballad a legend a bit of rural usage takes a light of glory from the page in which it is found <\s>

<s> these have been hitherto given with tantalising and almost provoking fragmentariness in the memoirs and in the centenary edition of the poems again withdrawn in the recent rossetti edition <\s>
<s> in these notes many of which in both senses are elaborate and full are some of the deepest and daintiest worded things from wordsworth <\s>
<s> are delightfully chatty and informal and ages hence will be treasured and studied in relation to the poems by the then myriad millions of the english speaking races <\s>
<s> miss fenwick to whom the world is indebted for these mss is immortalised in two sonnets by wordsworth which surely long ere this ought to have been included in the poetical works and they may fitly reappear here from the memoirs ): on a portrait of i f painted by margaret gillies <\s>
<s> we gaze nor grieve to think that we must die but that the precious love this friend hath sown within our hearts the love whose flower hath blown bright as if heaven were ever in its eye will pass so soon from human memory and not by strangers to our blood alone but by our best descendants be unknown unthought of this may surely claim a sigh <\s>
<s> yet blessed art we yield not to dejection thou against time so feelingly dost strive where'er preserved in this most true reflection an image of her soul is kept alive some lingering fragrance of the pure affection whose flower with us will vanish must survive <\s>
<s> rydal mount new year's day 1840 <\s>
<s> to i f the star which comes at close of day to shine more heavenly bright than when it leads the morn is friendship's emblem whether the forlorn she visiteth or shedding light benign through shades that solemnise life's calm decline doth make the happy happier <\s>
<s> this have we learnt isabel from thy society which now we too unwillingly resign though for brief absence <\s>
<s> the page glimmers before my sight through thankful tears such as start forth not seldom to approve our truth when we old yet unchill'd by age call thee though known but for a few fleet years the heart affianced sister of our love <\s>

<s> 1873 ); e g i take great delight in miss fenwick and in her conversation <\s>
<s> well should i like to have her constantly in the drawing room to come down to and from my little study up stairs her mind is such a noble compound of heart and intelligence of spiritual feeling and moral strength and the most perfect feminineness <\s>
<s> she is intellectual but what is a great excellence never talks for effect never keeps possession of the floor as clever women are so apt to do <\s>
<s> she converses for the interchange of thought and feeling no matter how so she gets at your mind and lets you into hers <\s>
<s> a more generous and a tenderer heart i never knew <\s>

<s> she is a noble creature all tenderness and strength <\s>
<s> when i first became acquainted with her i saw at once that her heart was of the very finest richest quality and her wisdom and insight are as ever must be in such a case exactly correspondent ibid <\s>
<s> such words from one so penetrative so indeceivable so great in the fullest sense as was the daughter of the coleridge makes every one long to have the same service done for miss fenwick as has been done for sara coleridge and miss hare and within these weeks for mrs <\s>
<s> her diaries and correspondence would be inestimable to lovers of wordsworth for few or none got so near to him or entered so magnetically into his thinking <\s>

<s> these are arranged as nearly as possible chronologically from the memoirs c <\s>
<s> c with the benefit as before of collation in many cases of the original mss especially in the sir w r <\s>
<s> hamilton letters and a number are for the first time printed <\s>
<s> the editor does not at all like extracts and must be permitted to regret that what in his judgment was an antiquated and mistaken idea of biography led the excellent as learned bishop of lincoln to abridge and mutilate so very many the places not always marked <\s>
<s> on this and the principle and motif which approve and vindicate the publication of the letters of every really potential intellect such as wordsworth's the accomplished daughter of sara coleridge has remarked a book composed of epistolary extracts can never be a wholly satisfactory one because its contents are not only relative and fragmentary but unauthorised and unrevised <\s>
<s> to arrest the passing utterances of the hour and reveal to the world that which was spoken either in the innermost circle of home affection or in the outer but still guarded circle of social or friendly intercourse seems almost like a betrayal of confidence and is a step which cannot be taken by survivors without some feelings of hesitation and reluctance <\s>
<s> that reluctance is only to be overcome by the sense that however natural it is partly founded on delusion a delusion which leads us to personify the world to our imagination as an obtuse and somewhat hostile individual who is certain to take things by the wrong handle and cannot be trusted to make the needful allowance and supply the inevitable omissions <\s>
<s> whereas it is a more reasonable and a more comfortable belief that the only part of the world which is in the least likely to concern itself with such volumes as these is composed of a number of enlightened and sympathetic persons as before preface vii <\s>
<s> the closing consideration ought to overweigh all scruples and reserve 10 10 the charming journal in full of miss wordsworth has only within the past year been published <\s>
<s> the welcome it has met with having bounded into a third edition already is at once proof of the soundness of judgment that at long last issued it if it be also accusatory that many have gone who yearned to read it <\s>
<s> the editor ventures to invite special attention to wordsworth's own express wish that the foreign journals of miss wordsworth and mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth should be published <\s>
<s> surely his words ought to be imperative vol <\s>
<s> there is the select circle of lovers of wordsworth yearly widening and there are the far off multitudes of the future to whom william wordsworth will be the grand name of the 18th 19th century and all that shakespeare and milton are now and consequently the letters of one so chary in letter writing ought to be put beyond the risks of loss and given to literature in entirety and trueness <\s>
<s> wordsworth had a morbid dislike of writing letters his weak eyes throughout rendering all penmanship painful but the present editor while conceding that his letters lack the charm of style of cowper's and the vividness and passion of byron's finds in them even the hastiest matter of rarest biographic and interpretative value <\s>
<s> he was not a great sentencemaker in a way prided himself that his letters were so intentionally poor as sure to be counted unworthy of publication and altogether had the prejudices of an earlier day against the giving of letters to the world but none the less are his letters informed with his intellect and meditative thoughtfulness and exquisiteness of feeling <\s>
<s> it is earnestly to be hoped that one of the family who is admirably qualified for the task of love will address himself to write adequately and confidingly the life of his immortal relative and toward this every one possessed of anything in the handwriting or from the mind of wordsworth may be appealed to for co operation <\s>
<s> the memoirs of the now bishop of lincoln within its own limits was a great gift but it is avowedly not a life and the world wants a life <\s>
<s> collation of the originals of these letters has restored sentences and words and things of the most characteristic kind <\s>
